# Project Management Standards Platform - Design Decision Document

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Frontend Framework Selection
**Decision:** React 18 + Vite
**Rationale:** 
- Modern React features (hooks, concurrent rendering)
- Vite provides fast development server and optimized builds
- Excellent ecosystem for component-based architecture
- Strong TypeScript support for future scalability

### 2. State Management Approach
**Decision:** React useState + useEffect (No external state management)
**Rationale:**
- Application complexity doesn't require Redux/Zustand
- Local state sufficient for component interactions
- Simpler debugging and maintenance
- Reduced bundle size

### 3. Data Storage Strategy
**Decision:** JSON files + Text files (No database)
**Rationale:**
- Static content doesn't require dynamic database
- Faster loading with pre-processed data
- Easier deployment and version control
- Cost-effective for read-heavy application

### 4. AI Integration Architecture
**Decision:** Client-side AI with Transformers.js
**Rationale:**
- No server costs for AI processing
- Privacy-first approach (data stays in browser)
- Offline capability for search functionality
- Uses proven all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model

### 5. Search Implementation
**Decision:** Hybrid Search (Keyword + Semantic)
**Rationale:**
- Keyword search for exact matches and fast results
- Semantic search for meaning-based discovery
- Fallback mechanism ensures reliability
- Progressive enhancement (keyword first, AI second)

### 6. Content Processing Pipeline
**Decision:** Multi-format content support
**Rationale:**
- JSON for structured book data (hierarchical navigation)
- Text files for insights and comparisons
- PDF integration for downloads
- Flexible parsing for different content types

## UI/UX Design Decisions

### 1. Design System
**Decision:** Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS Variables
**Rationale:**
- Rapid prototyping and consistent styling
- Light, skin-toned color palette for professional appearance
- Utility-first approach for maintainable styles
- Custom animations for engaging user experience

### 2. Navigation Architecture
**Decision:** Dashboard-centric navigation
**Rationale:**
- Single entry point reduces cognitive load
- Clear separation of major features (Search, Comparison, Read)
- Breadcrumb navigation for deep content access
- Mobile-first responsive design

### 3. Content Display Strategy
**Decision:** Progressive disclosure with multi-level navigation
**Rationale:**
- Book → Section → Topic → Subtopic → Content hierarchy
- Reduces information overload
- Maintains context while drilling down
- Consistent navigation patterns across features

### 4. Animation Philosophy
**Decision:** Subtle, non-interfering animations
**Rationale:**
- Background elements create living interface
- Page transitions provide spatial awareness
- Animations enhance without distracting
- Performance-optimized with CSS transforms

### 5. Comparison Interface Design
**Decision:** Side-by-side comparison with visual heatmap
**Rationale:**
- Visual comparison matrix for quick overview
- Detailed side-by-side for in-depth analysis
- Toggle between views for different use cases
- Interactive elements for exploration

### 6. Search Experience Design
**Decision:** Progressive search with AI enhancement
**Rationale:**
- Immediate keyword results for fast access
- Optional AI search for deeper discovery
- Clear indication of search types and performance
- Deep linking to relevant content

## Technical Implementation Decisions

### 1. Build and Deployment
**Decision:** Vite + Vercel
**Rationale:**
- Vite provides modern build tooling
- Vercel offers seamless GitHub integration
- Static site generation for optimal performance
- CDN distribution for global accessibility

### 2. Performance Optimization
**Decision:** Lazy loading + Code splitting
**Rationale:**
- AI models loaded only when needed
- Reduced initial bundle size
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Resource management for browser stability

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
**Decision:** Graceful degradation with user feedback
**Rationale:**
- Fallback to keyword search if AI fails
- Clear error messages and progress indicators
- Non-blocking error handling
- User-friendly timeout management

### 4. Content Parsing Approach
**Decision:** Custom parsers for different book formats
**Rationale:**
- PMBOK: Flat JSON structure with filtering
- ISO: Nested JSON with recursive parsing
- PRINCE2: Structured JSON with hierarchy
- Flexible parsing accommodates different sources

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Component architecture supports feature additions
- Modular design allows for easy maintenance
- JSON-based data can migrate to database if needed
- AI integration can scale with better models

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for new book formats
- Configurable comparison matrices
- Extensible search algorithms
- Customizable UI themes

### Maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance monitoring capabilities
- Version control for content updates
