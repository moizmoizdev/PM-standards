PRINCE2 is built on a foundation of seven principles that are "guiding obligations" to determine if a project is genuinely managed using PRINCE2 and ensure its effective application and tailoring. These principles are universal and apply to every PRINCE2 project.
{b}Ensure continued business justification:{b} A PRINCE2 project must have a justifiable reason for starting, which remains valid throughout its lifecycle. The business justification drives all key decisions, ensuring alignment with benefits and business objectives. If the justification ceases to be valid, the project should be stopped.
{b}Learn from experience:{b} A PRINCE2 project actively seeks, records, and implements improvements based on lessons learned from prior projects and continuously throughout its own lifecycle. This learning process occurs when starting the project, as it progresses, and when it closes, and involves sharing insights for future application.
{b}Define roles, responsibilities, and relationships:{b} Every PRINCE2 project establishes a clear organizational structure with defined and agreed roles and responsibilities for all stakeholders, including business, user, and supplier interests. This clarity facilitates effective communication and relationship building.
{b}Manage by exception:{b} A PRINCE2 project establishes predefined limits of delegated authority (tolerances) for its performance targets. Deviations, or forecasts of deviations, beyond these tolerances are escalated to the next management level for a decision, allowing for efficient use of senior management time.
{b}Manage by stages:{b} A PRINCE2 project is planned, monitored, and controlled on a stage-by-stage basis. This approach provides regular review and decision points at the end of each stage, allowing the Project Board to assess viability and adapt before committing resources to the next stage.
{b}Focus on products:{b} A PRINCE2 project prioritizes the definition and delivery of its products, including their user quality expectations and requirements. This product-oriented approach ensures clear scope, reduces ambiguity, and helps prevent unnecessary work or "scope creep."
{b}Tailor to suit the project:{b} PRINCE2 is designed to be adaptable and should be applied and customized to fit the specific project environment, including its size, complexity, importance, delivery method, team capability, and level of risk. Tailoring ensures the method remains relevant and effective for the unique context.
