The PMI standards, particularly The Standard for Project Management – Seventh Edition, are built upon 12 Project Management Principles. These principles are "foundational guidelines for strategy, decision making, and problem solving" that are non-prescriptive and intended to guide the behavior of individuals involved in projects. They are broadly based and align with PMI’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
{b}Be a Diligent, Respectful, and Caring Steward:{b} This principle emphasizes being entrusted with care, responsible management of resources, and upholding values and ethics. It involves aligning with organizational objectives, committing to project team members, diligently overseeing resources, and understanding authority and accountability, extending to environmental and social responsibilities.
{b}Create a Collaborative Project Team Environment:{b} Fostering a project team culture that encourages cooperation and mutual respect among diverse individuals. This is achieved through establishing team agreements, appropriate structures, and processes that facilitate effective interactions and synergistic effects.
{b}Effectively Engage with Stakeholders:{b} Proactively identifying, analyzing, and engaging with all individuals, groups, or organizations that may affect or be affected by the project. This involves fostering positive relationships, managing expectations, resolving issues, and using soft skills to promote productive involvement.
{b}Focus on Value:{b} Value, from the perspective of the customer or end-user, is the ultimate indicator of project success. This principle guides teams to prioritize and deliver outcomes that provide tangible and intangible benefits to the sponsoring organization and stakeholders, aligning with strategic objectives.
{b}Recognize, Evaluate, and Respond to System Interactions:{b} A project is viewed as a system of interacting components within larger systems. This principle encourages a holistic view, balancing internal and external perspectives, and managing dynamic circumstances to navigate changes and their impacts effectively.
{b}Demonstrate Leadership Behaviors:{b} Effective leadership is critical for project success, involving influencing, motivating, directing, and coaching individuals towards desired outcomes. Leaders adapt their styles to situations, articulate vision, and foster an environment of vision, creativity, and empathy.
{b}Tailor Based on Context:{b} Project management approaches, governance, and processes should be deliberately adapted to suit the unique context of each project, including its objectives, stakeholders, and environment. Tailoring ensures efficiency and effectiveness, avoiding a "one-size-fits-all" mentality.
{b}Build Quality into Processes and Deliverables:{b} Quality is the degree to which inherent characteristics fulfill requirements. This principle advocates for designing quality into both project processes and deliverables from the outset, aiming to prevent defects, reduce rework, and ensure deliverables meet customer expectations and specifications.
{b}Navigate Complexity:{b} Projects often exist in complex environments characterized by human and system behaviors and ambiguity. This principle guides teams to develop strategies, such as decoupling, simulation, and reframing, to understand, adapt to, and address the challenges arising from complexity.
{b}Optimize Risk Responses:{b} Proactively identifying, analyzing, and planning responses for both individual and overall project risks (threats and opportunities). The goal is to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative ones, considering strategies like avoidance, exploitation, transfer, mitigation, enhancement, and acceptance.
{b}Embrace Adaptability and Resiliency:{b} Project teams should be adaptable (able to respond to changing conditions) and resilient (able to absorb impacts and recover quickly from setbacks). This includes fostering short feedback loops, continuous learning, and flexible planning to thrive in dynamic environments.
{b}Enable Change to Achieve the Envisioned Future State:{b} Projects are agents of change, and this principle focuses on actively preparing organizations and stakeholders for transitions. It emphasizes managing the pace of change, addressing resistance, and reinforcing new capabilities to ensure the sustained realization of benefits from project outcomes.
