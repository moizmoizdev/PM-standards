The ISO standards, particularly ISO 21500 which provides context and concepts, articulate fundamental guiding ideas that underpin the governance and management of projects, programs, and portfolios. While ISO 21500 does not explicitly label them as "principles" in a numbered list like other standards, it describes "underlying concepts" that "should guide the thinking and behaviour for the governance and management of projects, programmes and portfolios." These concepts are essential for directing and controlling projects effectively.
{b}Strategic Alignment:{b} Projects, programmes, and portfolios should be linked to an organization's overall strategy and objectives. This ensures that all initiatives contribute to the larger strategic direction.
{b}Continuous Justification:{b} There must be an ongoing rationale for undertaking and continuing projects, programmes, and portfolios. This involves regularly confirming that expected benefits can be realized and risks managed, and terminating work if justification is no longer supported.
{b}Appropriate Framework:{b} The governance and management frameworks and controls used should be proportionate and appropriate to the specific work being performed, the associated risks, and the organization's acceptable level of risk.
{b}Stakeholder Engagement and Communications:{b} Deliverables, outputs, and outcomes should meet the agreed needs expressed by the sponsoring organization and be accepted by stakeholders. Effective engagement and communication are crucial across all levels.
{b}Clear Roles and Responsibilities:{b} Authority and accountability should be clearly defined, assigned, consistent, and traceable across all levels of a project, programme, or portfolio.
{b}Appropriate Planning and Management:{b} Work should be planned appropriately, and quality actively managed. Ways of working should be tailored to maximize the likelihood of success within any given project, programme, or portfolio environment.
{b}Continuous Improvement:{b} Experience and lessons learned should be captured within the organizational knowledge base. This knowledge should then be shared and used to promote future performance improvement in projects, programmes, and portfolios.
These underlying concepts collectively contribute to an integrated governance and management approach for projects, programmes, and portfolios, fostering a common understanding of strategies, objectives, and plans, focusing on strategic objectives, enabling transparency and alignment, facilitating communication, ensuring transparency of resource utilization, and clarifying progress through consistent reporting and decision procedures.
