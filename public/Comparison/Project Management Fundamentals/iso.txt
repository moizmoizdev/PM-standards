{b}Definition of a Project:{b}
A project is a "temporary endeavour to achieve one or more defined objectives." This highlights its finite nature, distinguishing it from ongoing operational activities.
{b}Definition of Project Management:{b}
Project management encompasses "coordinated activities to direct and control the accomplishment of agreed objectives." It is the application of methods, tools, techniques, and competencies to enable the project to meet these objectives.
{b}Core Context and Purpose of Project Management:{b}
Projects do not exist in isolation but operate within a dynamic environment shaped by both internal and external factors. Their primary purpose is to drive change and deliver value by aligning with an organization's strategic goals.
{b}Strategy Implementation and Value Delivery:{b} Opportunities and threats, identified through organizational strategy and objectives, are evaluated and transformed into requirements and business cases. These business cases justify and authorize projects and programs to provide deliverables, outputs, and outcomes. When integrated into operations, these outcomes are expected to realize benefits for various stakeholders (internal and external) and can further inform or evolve the organization's strategy.
{b}Integrated Management Framework:{b} Project, programme, and portfolio management provide an integrated framework for managing these initiatives to deliver value. Projects may be stand-alone, or they can be components of larger programmes or portfolios, ensuring their objectives and governance align with the overarching strategic direction.
{b}Key Project Characteristics (expanded from ISO 21502):{b}
Temporary: Projects have a definite beginning and end, not necessarily implying a short duration. Termination occurs when objectives are met or unachievable, funding is exhausted, the need ceases, resources are unavailable, or for legal/convenience reasons.
Outputs, Outcomes, and Benefits: Projects are designed to produce aggregated tangible or intangible deliverables (outputs) that form the project result. These outputs lead to changes (outcomes) which, in turn, enable the creation of advantages, value or other positive effects (benefits) for stakeholders and the sponsoring organization.
Contextual Influences: Projects are deeply impacted by their context. This includes internal organizational factors such as strategy, technology maturity, resource availability, organizational culture, and structure. External factors like socio-economic conditions, political climate, regulatory environments, technological advancements, and ecological considerations also impose requirements, constraints, or risks.
Constraints: Project work must be achieved within identified constraints, including duration/target dates, funding availability, approved budgets, resource availability (people, facilities, equipment, materials, tools), health and safety, security, acceptable risk levels, potential social/environmental/ecological impacts, laws, rules, and minimum quality standards. These constraints are often interrelated and require careful balancing and periodic review.
{b}Overall Project Management Approach:{b} Project management involves a set of coordinated activities and practices (initiate, plan, monitor, control, and close) to direct the accomplishment of agreed objectives. It includes managing resources, motivating project personnel, and creating a conducive project environment. The approach should be designed as a system, with practices tailored for a specific project.
