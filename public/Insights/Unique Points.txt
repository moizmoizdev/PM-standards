{b}Unique Points (What Only One Standard Covers){b}
Each standard has unique elements that define its specific approach to project management.
{b}Unique to PRINCE2:{b}
{b}Seven Principles:{b} The seven principles (e.g., {b}Continued Business Justification{b}, {b}Learn from Experience{b}, {b}Manage by Stages{b}) are the bedrock of the method. A project is not considered a "{b}PRINCE2 project{b}" unless all seven principles are being applied.
{b}Manage by Exception Principle:{b} This is a core control mechanism. Management levels delegate authority to the level below by setting tolerances for the seven performance targets. The lower level only needs to report back ("escalate") if a forecast indicates that tolerances will be exceeded.
{b}Seven Defined Processes:{b} {b}PRINCE2{b} defines a specific, chronological flow of processes: {b}Starting up a Project{b}, {b}Directing a Project{b}, {b}Initiating a Project{b}, {b}Controlling a Stage{b}, {b}Managing Product Delivery{b}, {b}Managing a Stage Boundary{b}, and {b}Closing a Project{b}.
{b}Seven Performance Targets:{b} The explicit definition and management of seven aspects of project performance ({b}Benefits{b}, {b}Costs{b}, {b}Time{b}, {b}Quality{b}, {b}Scope{b}, {b}Sustainability{b}, {b}Risk{b}) is a unique and central feature.
{b}Focus on People:{b} {b}PRINCE2 7{b} introduces a dedicated, integrated element focusing on "{b}People{b}," covering aspects like leading successful change, managing teams, and communication as central to the method's application.
{b}Unique to PMI (PMBOK® 7th Edition):{b}
{b}System for Value Delivery:{b} This is a unique conceptual model that frames how portfolios, programs, projects, and operations work together to create value for an organization. It provides the overarching context for project work.
{b}Project Performance Domains:{b} The structure of project management activities into eight concurrent and interrelated {b}Performance Domains{b} ({b}Stakeholder{b}, {b}Team{b}, {b}Development Approach & Life Cycle{b}, {b}Planning{b}, {b}Project Work{b}, {b}Delivery{b}, {b}Measurement{b}, {b}Uncertainty{b}) is unique to this edition and represents a significant shift from a process-based model.
{b}Integration with PMIstandards+™:{b} The standard is designed as a foundational guide, with a direct link to a dynamic, digital platform that provides an expandable repository of {b}Models{b}, {b}Methods{b}, and {b}Artifacts{b}. This allows the body of knowledge to evolve continuously without republishing the entire standard.
{b}The Standard for Project Management:{b} This is a distinct document (bound with the {b}PMBOK® Guide{b}) that formally presents the {b}12 principles{b} as an {b}ANSI standard{b}, separating the foundational "why" from the practical "how" described in the guide.
{b}Unique to the ISO Standards:{b}
{b}Overarching Guidance, Not a Methodology:{b} The most unique aspect of the {b}ISO standards{b} is their purpose. They are not intended to be a project management methodology themselves but rather a high-level, internationally recognized set of guidelines and concepts that organizations can use to develop their own methodologies or to benchmark existing ones.
{b}Separation of Context and Guidance:{b} The standard is uniquely split into two primary documents: {b}ISO 21500{b} focuses on the high-level context and concepts that connect projects, programs, and portfolios to organizational strategy, while {b}ISO 21502{b} provides more detailed guidance specifically on project management practices.
{b}Broad Applicability:{b} As an international standard, it is explicitly designed to be applicable to most organizations regardless of size or type (public, private, charitable) and to any project regardless of complexity, size, or duration, without prescribing specific tools or techniques.
