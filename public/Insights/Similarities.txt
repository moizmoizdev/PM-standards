{b}Similarities (Common Practices and Overlapping Guidance){b}
Despite their different structures and terminologies, all three standards share a common foundation of core project management concepts.
{b}Core Definitions of Project and Project Management{b}
All three standards agree on the fundamental definition of a project as a temporary endeavor.
{b}ISO:{b} "temporary endeavour to achieve one or more defined objectives."
{b}PRINCE2:{b} "a temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products."
{b}PMI:{b} "a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result."
They all define project management as the act of applying knowledge, activities, or methods to direct and control a project to achieve its objectives.
{b}Business Justification and Value{b}
All three standards anchor the existence of a project in its ability to deliver value and maintain a valid business justification.
The concept of a {b}Business Case{b} is central to all three. It serves as the documented justification for the project, outlining the balance of costs, benefits, and risks.
They all emphasize that this justification must be reviewed and revalidated throughout the project's life cycle to ensure the project remains desirable, viable, and achievable.
{b}Stakeholder Focus{b}
Identifying, analyzing, and engaging with stakeholders is a critical and continuous activity across all three standards.
They all recognize that stakeholders can be internal or external and that their needs, expectations, and influence must be managed to ensure project success.
{b}Core Management Activities{b}
All standards cover a common set of essential project management activities or practices, even if they are grouped differently. These universally recognized areas include:
{b}Planning:{b} Defining the scope, schedule, cost, resources, and methods for achieving project objectives.
{b}Risk Management:{b} Identifying, assessing, and controlling uncertainty (both threats and opportunities).
{b}Quality Management:{b} Ensuring that deliverables are fit for purpose and meet specified requirements.
{b}Change Control:{b} Managing modifications to the project's baselines in a controlled manner.
{b}Communication:{b} Ensuring timely and appropriate flow of information among stakeholders.
{b}Concept of Tailoring{b}
A strong point of convergence is the explicit requirement to tailor the project management approach.
All three standards state that their frameworks, methods, or guidance are not one-size-fits-all and must be adapted to the specific context of the project, including its size, complexity, environment, and importance.
