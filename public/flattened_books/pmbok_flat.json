In the time between every edition, a world of change has occurred. Some organizations have ceased to exist, and new organizations have emerged. Older technologies have reached end of life while technologies offering completely new capabilities have evolved. People who continue in the workforce have advanced their thinking, skills, and capabilities as new entrants focus on quickly understanding their professional language, building their skills, developing their business acumen, and contributing to the objectives of their employers.\nEven in the midst of such changes, though, there are fundamental concepts and constructs that remain in place. The understanding that collective thinking produces more holistic solutions than the thoughts of one individual continues. And the fact that organizations use projects as a vehicle for delivering a unique result or output endures."

      "content": "Since its inception as the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) in 1987, A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) has evolved while recognizing that fundamental elements of project management endure. Its evolution has not just involved an increase in the page count, it has also involved significant and substantive changes in the nature of the content. A sampling of some of those key changes is reflected in the following table:\nEvolution of Key Changes in the PMBOK® Guide\nLike previous editions of The Standard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide, this edition recognizes that the project management landscape continues to evolve and adapt. Over the past 10 years alone, the advancement of software into all types of products, services, and solutions has grown exponentially. What software can enable continues to change as artificial intelligence, cloud-based capabilities, and new business models drive innovation and new ways of working. Transformed organizational models have yielded new project work and team structures, the need for a broad range of approaches to project and product delivery, and a stronger focus on outcomes rather than deliverables. Individual contributors can join project teams from anywhere in the world, serve in a broader array of roles, and enable new ways of thinking and working collaboratively. These changes and more have created this opportunity to reconsider perspectives to support the continued evolution of The Standard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide."

      "subtopic": "SUMMARY OF CHANGES",
      "subsubtopic": "content",
      "content": "Since 1987, The Standard for Project Management has represented a process-based standard. The Standard for Project Management included in the PMBOK® Guide aligned the project management discipline and function around a collection of business processes. Those business processes enabled consistent and predictable practices:\n▶ That could be documented;\n▶ Through which performance against the processes could be assessed; and\n▶ Through which improvements to the process could be made to maximize efficiency and minimize threats.\nWhile effective in supporting good practice, process-based standards are prescriptive by their very nature. With project management evolving more rapidly than ever before, the process-based orientation of past editions cannot be maintained in a manner conducive to reflecting the full value delivery landscape. Therefore, this edition shifts to a principles-based standard to support effective project management and to focus more on intended outcomes rather than deliverables.\nA global community of practitioners from different industries and organizations, in different roles, and working on different types of projects have developed and/or provided feedback on drafts of the standard as it has evolved for this edition. In addition, the PMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition coleaders and staff reviewed other bodies of knowledge and works focused on project management to identify principle concepts embedded in those texts. These combined efforts showed strong alignment and supported the validation that the guiding principles in this edition of the standard apply across the spectrum of project management.\nTo date, the global project management community has embraced the shift of this standard toward a set of principle statements. The principle statements capture and summarize generally accepted objectives for the practice of project management and its core functions. The principle statements provide broad parameters within which project teams can operate and offer many ways to remain aligned with the intent of the principles.\nUsing these principle statements, PMI can reflect effective management of projects across the full value delivery landscape: predictive to adaptive and everything in between. This principles-based approach is also consistent with the evolution of The Standard for Program Management (Third and Fourth Editions) and The Standard for Portfolio Management – Fourth Edition. The Standard for Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects and Benefits Realization Management: A Practice Guide represent new standard products intentionally developed with a principles-based focus by global teams of subject matter experts.\nNothing in this edition of The Standard for Project Management or A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge negates alignment with the process-based approach of past editions. Many organizations and practitioners continue to find that approach useful for guiding their project management capabilities, aligning their methodologies, and evaluating their project management capabilities. That approach remains relevant in the context of this new edition.\nAnother significant change with this edition of the PMBOK® Guide is a systems view of project management. This shift begins with a systems view of value delivery as part of The Standard for Project Management and continues with the presentation of the PMBOK® Guide content. A systems focus for value delivery changes the perspective from one of governing portfolios, programs, and projects to focusing on the value chain that links those and other business capabilities to advancing organizational strategy, value, and business objectives. In the context of project management, The Standard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide emphasize that projects do not simply produce outputs, but more importantly, enable those outputs to drive outcomes that ultimately deliver value to the organization and its stakeholders.\nThis systems view reflects a shift from the Knowledge Areas in past editions of the PMBOK® Guide to eight project performance domains. A performance domain is a group of related activities that are critical for the effective delivery of project outcomes. Collectively, the performance domains represent a project management system of interactive, interrelated, and interdependent management capabilities that work in unison to achieve desired project outcomes. As the performance domains interact and react to each other, change occurs. Project teams continuously review, discuss, adapt, and respond to such changes with the whole system in mind—not just the specific performance domain in which the change occurred. Aligned with the concept of a system for value delivery in The Standard for Project Management, teams evaluate effective performance in each performance domain through outcomes-focused measures, rather than through adherence to processes or the production of artifacts, plans, etc.\nPrevious editions of the PMBOK® Guide emphasized the importance of tailoring the project management approach to the unique characteristics of each project and its context. The Sixth Edition specifically incorporated considerations to help project teams think about how to tailor their approach to project management. That content was included in the front matter of each of the Knowledge Areas and provided considerations for all types of project environments. This edition further expands upon that work with a dedicated section on Tailoring in the PMBOK® Guide.\nA new section on Models, Methods, and Artifacts provides a high-level grouping of models, methods, and artifacts that support project management. This section maintains linkages to tools, techniques, and outputs from previous editions that support project management without prescribing when, how, or which tools teams should use.\nThe final change reflects the most significant advancement in the PMBOK® Guide's history—the creation of PMIstandards+™, an interactive digital platform that incorporates current, emerging, and future practices, methods, artifacts, and other useful information. The digital content better reflects the dynamic nature of a body of knowledge. PMIstandards+ provides project practitioners and other stakeholders with access to a richer and broader range of information and resources that can more quickly accommodate advances and changes in project management. The content explains how specific practices, methods, or artifacts apply to projects based on industry segments, project types, or other characteristics. Starting with the inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs from the PMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition, PMIstandards+ will continue to incorporate new resources that support continued evolution in project management. Going forward, users of The Standard for Project Management and the PMBOK® Guide can find information in PMIstandards+ that will supplement the information included in the printed publication.\nThe following figure illustrates the revision to The Standard for Project Management and migration from the Sixth to the Seventh Edition of the PMBOK® Guide, along with the connection to the PMIstandards+ digital platform.\n(Content from Diagram)\nPMBOK® Guide – Sixth Edition:\n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge: \n • Introduction, Project Environment, and Role of the Project Manager \n • Knowledge Areas: Integration, Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resources, Communications, Procurement, Stakeholders\n The Standard for Project Management: \n • Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, Closing \n Appendixes, Glossary, and Index\n\nPMBOK® Guide – Seventh Edition:\n The Standard for Project Management: \n • Introduction \n • System for Value Delivery \n • Project Management Principles: Stewardship, Team, Stakeholders, Value, Systems Thinking, Leadership, Tailoring, Quality, Complexity, Risk, Adaptability and Resiliency, Change \n A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge: \n • Project Performance Domains: Stakeholders, Team, Development Approach and Life Cycle, Planning, Project Work, Delivery, Measurement, Uncertainty \n • Tailoring \n • Models, Methods, and Artifacts \n Appendixes, Glossary, and Index\n\nPMIstandards+™ Digital Content Platform:\n • The platform links to the PMBOK® Guide via the Models, Methods, and Artifacts section while further expanding on that content. \n • Platform incorporates content from all PMI standards as well as content developed specifically for the platform. \n • Content reflects “how to…” in actual practice, including emerging practices."

Project managers are expected to deliver projects that create value for the organization and stakeholders within the organization's system for value delivery. The following terms are defined to provide context for the content in this standard.\n▶ Outcome. An end result or consequence of a process or project. Outcomes can include outputs and artifacts, but have a broader intent by focusing on the benefits and value that the project was undertaken to deliver.\n▶ Portfolio. Projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group to achieve strategic objectives.\n▶ Product. An artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end item in itself or a component item.\n▶ Program. Related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities that are managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.\n▶ Project. A temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. The temporary nature of projects indicates a beginning and an end to the project work or a phase of the project work. Projects can stand alone or be part of a program or portfolio.\n▶ Project management. The application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements. Project management refers to guiding the project work to deliver the intended outcomes. Project teams can achieve the outcomes using a broad range of approaches (e.g., predictive, hybrid, and adaptive).\n▶ Project manager. The person assigned by the performing organization to lead the project team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives. Project managers perform a variety of functions, such as facilitating the project team work to achieve the outcomes and managing the processes to deliver intended outcomes. Additional functions are identified in Section 2.3.\n▶ Project team. A set of individuals performing the work of the project to achieve its objectives.\n▶ System for value delivery. A collection of strategic business activities aimed at building, sustaining, and/or advancing an organization. Portfolios, programs, projects, products, and operations can all be part of an organization's system for value delivery.\n▶ Value. The worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Different stakeholders perceive value in different ways. Customers can define value as the ability to use specific features or functions of a product. Organizations can focus on business value as determined with financial metrics, such as the benefits less the cost of achieving those benefits. Societal value can include the contribution to groups of people, communities, or the environment.\nFor other terms used in this standard, refer to the Glossary and the PMI Lexicon of Project Management Terms [1].1"

      "content": "Projects exist within a larger system, such as a governmental agency, organization, or contractual arrangement. For the sake of brevity, this standard uses the term organization when referring to government agencies, enterprises, contractual arrangements, joint ventures, and other arrangements. Organizations create value for stakeholders. Examples of ways that projects produce value include, but are not limited to:\n▶ Creating a new product, service, or result that meets the needs of customers or end users;\n▶ Creating positive social or environmental contributions;\n▶ Improving efficiency, productivity, effectiveness, or responsiveness;\n▶ Enabling the changes needed to facilitate organizational transition to its desired future state; and\n▶ Sustaining benefits enabled by previous programs, projects, or business operations.\n2.1.1 VALUE DELIVERY COMPONENTS\nThere are various components, such as portfolios, programs, projects, products, and operations, that can be used individually and collectively to create value. Working together, these components comprise a system for delivering value that is aligned with the organization's strategy. Figure 2-1 shows an example of a system to deliver value that has two portfolios comprised of programs and projects. It also shows a stand-alone program with projects and stand-alone projects not associated with portfolios or programs. Any of the projects or programs could include products. Operations can directly support and influence portfolios, programs, and projects, as well as other business functions, such as payroll, supply chain management, and so forth. Portfolios, programs, and projects influence each other as well as operations.\nAs shown in Figure 2-2, a system for value delivery is part of an organization's internal environment that is subject to policies, procedures, methodologies, frameworks, governance structures, and so forth. That internal environment exists within the larger external environment, which includes the economy, the competitive environment, legislative constraints, etc. Section 2.4 provides more detail on internal and external environments.\nThe components in a value delivery system create deliverables used to produce outcomes. An outcome is the end result or consequence of a process or a project. Focusing on outcomes, choices, and decisions emphasizes the long-range performance of the project. The outcomes create benefits, which are gains realized by the organization. Benefits, in turn, create value, which is something of worth, importance, or usefulness.\n2.1.2 INFORMATION FLOW\nA value delivery system works most effectively when information and feedback are shared consistently among all components, keeping the system aligned with strategy and attuned to the environment.\nFigure 2-3 shows a model of the flow of information where black arrows represent information from senior leadership to portfolios, portfolios to programs and projects, and then to operations. Senior leadership shares strategic information with portfolios. Portfolios share the desired outcomes, benefits, and value with programs and projects. Deliverables from programs and projects are passed on to operations along with information on support and maintenance for the deliverables.\nThe light gray arrows in Figure 2-3 represent the reverse flow of information. Information from operations to programs and projects suggests adjustments, fixes, and updates to deliverables. Programs and projects provide performance information and progress on achieving the desired outcomes, benefits, and value to portfolios. Portfolios provide evaluations on portfolio performance with senior leadership. Additionally, operations provide information on how well the organization's strategy is advancing."

Governance systems provide a framework with functions and processes that guide activities. A governance framework can include elements of oversight, control, value assessment, integration among components, and decision making capabilities.\nGovernance systems provide an integrated structure for evaluating changes, issues, and risks associated with the environment and any component in the value delivery system. This includes portfolio objectives, program benefits, and deliverables produced by projects.\nProjects can operate within a program or portfolio or as a stand-alone activity. In some organizations, a project management office might support programs and projects within a portfolio. Project governance includes defining the authority to approve changes and make other business decisions related to the project. Project governance is aligned with program and/or organizational governance."

      "subsubtopic": "2.3 FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS",
      "content": "People drive project delivery. They do so by fulfilling functions necessary for the project to run effectively and efficiently. Functions related to the project can be fulfilled by one person, by a group of people, or combined into defined roles.\nCoordinating a collective work effort is extremely important to the success of any project. There are different types of coordination suitable for different contexts. Some projects benefit from decentralized coordination in which project team members self-organize and self-manage. Other projects benefit from centralized coordination with the leadership and guidance of a designated project manager or similar role. Some projects with centralized coordination can also benefit from including self-organized project teams for portions of the work. Regardless of how coordination takes place, supportive leadership models and meaningful, continuous engagements between project teams and other stakeholders underpin successful outcomes.\nRegardless of how projects are coordinated, the collective effort of the project team delivers the outcomes, benefits, and value. The project team may be supported by additional functions depending on the deliverables, industry, organization, and other variables. Sections 2.3.1 through 2.3.8 provide examples of functions that are often found on projects, though these are not a comprehensive list. In addition to these functions, other functions may be necessary to enable project deliverables that produce the desired outcomes. The needs of the project, organization, and environment influence which functions are used on a project and how those functions are carried out.\n2.3.1 PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION\nPeople in this function help the project team achieve the project objectives, typically by orchestrating the work of the project. The specifics of how this function is carried out within the project team can vary among organizations, but can include leading the planning, monitoring, and controlling activities. In some organizations, this function may involve some evaluation and analysis activities as part of pre-project activities. This function includes monitoring and working to improve the health, safety, and overall well-being of project team members.\nCoordination includes consulting with executive and business unit leaders on ideas for advancing objectives, improving project performance, or meeting customer needs. It can also include assisting in business analysis, tendering and contract negotiations, and business case development.\nOversight can be involved in follow-on activities related to benefits realization and sustainment after the project deliverables are finalized but before formal closure of the project. This function can support portfolios and programs within which the project is initiated. Ultimately, the function is tailored to fit the organization.\n2.3.2 PRESENT OBJECTIVES AND FEEDBACK\nPeople in this function contribute perspectives, insights, and clear direction from customers and end users. The customer and end user are not always synonymous. For the purpose of this standard, the customer is defined as the individual or group who has requested or is funding the project. The end user is the individual or group who will experience the direct use of the project deliverable.\nProjects need clear direction from customers and end users regarding project requirements, outcomes, and expectations. In adaptive and hybrid project environments, the need for ongoing feedback is greater because the project teams are exploring and developing product elements within specific increments. In some project environments, the customer or end user engages with the project team for periodic review and feedback. In some projects, a representative of the customer or client participates on the project team. The customer and end user input and feedback needs are determined by the nature of the project and the guidance or direction required.\n2.3.3 FACILITATE AND SUPPORT\nThe function of facilitation and support may be closely related to providing oversight and coordination, depending on the nature of the project. The work involves encouraging project team member participation, collaboration, and a shared sense of responsibility for the work output. Facilitation helps the project team create consensus around solutions, resolve conflicts, and make decisions. Facilitation is also required to coordinate meetings and contribute in an unbiased way to the advancement of project objectives.\nSupporting people through change and helping address obstacles that can prevent success is also required. This can include evaluating performance and providing individuals and project teams with feedback to help them learn, adapt, and improve.\n2.3.4 PERFORM WORK AND CONTRIBUTE INSIGHTS\nThis group of people provides the knowledge, skills, and experience necessary to produce the products and realize the outcomes of the project. Work can be full time or part time for the duration of the project or for a limited period, and the work can be colocated or virtual, depending on the environmental factors. Some work can be highly specialized, while other work can be done by project team members who have broad skill sets.\nGaining insights from cross-functional project team members representing different parts of the organization can provide a mix of internal perspectives, establish alliances with key business units, and encourage project team members to act as change agents within their functional areas. This work can extend into support functions (during or after the project) as the project deliverables are implemented or transitioned into operations.\n2.3.5 APPLY EXPERTISE\nPeople in this function provide the knowledge, vision, and expertise in a specific subject for a project. They offer advice and support throughout the organization, and contribute to the project team's learning process and work accuracy. These people can be external to the organization or can be internal project team members. They can be required for the whole project or during a specific time frame.\n2.3.6 PROVIDE BUSINESS DIRECTION AND INSIGHT\nPeople in this function guide and clarify the direction of the project or product outcome. This function involves prioritizing the requirements or backlog items based on business value, dependencies, and technical or operational risk. People in this function provide feedback to project teams and set direction for the next increment or element to be developed or delivered. The function involves interacting with other stakeholders, customers, and their project teams to define the product direction. The goal is to maximize the value of the project deliverable.\nIn adaptive and hybrid environments, direction and insight can be provided using a specific cadence. In predictive environments, there can be designated checkpoints for presentation of and feedback on project progress. In some instances, business direction can interact with funding and resourcing functions.\n2.3.7 PROVIDE RESOURCES AND DIRECTION\nPeople in this function promote the project and communicate the organization's vision, goals, and expectations to the project team and broader stakeholder community. They advocate for the project and the project team by helping to secure the decisions, resources, and authority that allow project activities to progress.\nPeople in this function serve as liaisons between senior management and the project team, play a supporting role in keeping projects aligned to business objectives, remove obstacles, and address issues outside the bounds of the project team's decision authority. People in this function provide an escalation path for problems, issues, or risks that project teams cannot resolve or manage on their own, such as a shortage of funding or other resources, or deadlines that cannot be met.\nThis function can facilitate innovation by identifying opportunities that arise within the project and communicating these to senior management. People in this function may monitor project outcomes after project closure to ensure the intended business benefits are realized.\n2.3.8 MAINTAIN GOVERNANCE\nPeople who fill a governance function approve and support recommendations made by the project team and monitor project progress in achieving the desired outcomes. They maintain linkages between project teams and strategic or business objectives that can change over the course of the project."

      "content": "The disciplines of portfolio, program, project, and product management are becoming more interlinked. While portfolio, program, and product management are beyond the scope of this standard, understanding each discipline and the relationships between them provides a useful context for projects whose deliverables are products.\nA product is an artifact that is produced, is quantifiable, and can be either an end item in itself or a component item. Product management involves the integration of people, data, processes, and business systems to create, maintain, and develop a product or service throughout its life cycle. The product life cycle is a series of phases that represents the evolution of a product, from introduction through growth, maturity, and to retirement.\nProduct management may initiate programs or projects at any point in the product life cycle to create or enhance specific components, functions, or capabilities (see Figure 2-4). The initial product may begin as a deliverable of a program or project. Throughout its life cycle, a new program or project may add or improve specific components, attributes, or capabilities that create additional value for customers and the sponsoring organization. In some instances, a program can encompass the full life cycle of a product or service to manage the benefits and create value for the organization more directly.\nProduct management can exist in different forms, including but not limited to:\n▶ Program management within a product life cycle. This approach incorporates related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities. For very large or long-running products, one or more product life cycle phases may be sufficiently complex to merit a set of programs and projects working together.\n▶ Project management within a product life cycle. This approach oversees development and maturing of product capabilities as an ongoing business activity. Portfolio governance charters individual projects as needed to perform enhancements and improvements or to produce other unique outcomes.\n▶ Product management within a program. This approach applies the full product life cycle within the purview and boundaries of a given program. A series of subsidiary programs or projects will be chartered to achieve specific benefits for a product. Those benefits can be enhanced by applying product management competencies like competitive analysis, customer acquisition, and customer advocacy.\nWhile product management is a separate discipline with its own body of knowledge, it represents a key integration point within the program management and project management disciplines. Programs and projects with deliverables that include products use a tailored and integrated approach that incorporates all of the relevant bodies of knowledge and their related practices, methods, and artifacts."

      "content": "Principles for a profession serve as foundational guidelines for strategy, decision making, and problem solving. Professional standards and methodologies are often based on principles. In some professions, principles serve as laws or rules, and are therefore prescriptive in nature. The principles of project management are not prescriptive in nature. They are intended to guide the behavior of people involved in projects. They are broadly based so there are many ways individuals and organizations can maintain alignment with the principles.\nPrinciples can, but do not necessarily, reflect morals. A code of ethics is related to morals. A code of ethics for a profession can be adopted by an individual or profession to establish expectations for moral conduct. The PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct [2] is based on four values that were identified as most important to the project management community:\n▶ Responsibility,\n▶ Respect,\n▶ Fairness, and\n▶ Honesty.\nThe 12 principles of project management are aligned with the values identified in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. They do not follow the same format, and they are not duplicative, rather the principles and the Code of Ethics are complementary.\nThe principles of project management were identified and developed by engaging a global community of project practitioners. The practitioners represent different industries, cultural backgrounds, and organizations in different roles and with experience in various types of projects. Multiple rounds of feedback resulted in 12 principles that provide guidance for effective project management.\nBecause the principles of project management provide guidance, the degree of application and the way in which they are applied are influenced by the context of the organization, project, deliverables, project team, stakeholders, and other factors. The principles are internally consistent, meaning that no principle contradicts any other principle. However, in practice there may be times when the principles can overlap. For example, guidance for navigating complexity can present information that is useful in recognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions or optimizing risk responses.\nPrinciples of project management can also have areas of overlap with general management principles. For example, both projects and business in general focus on delivering value. The methods may be somewhat different in projects as opposed to operations, but the underlying principle associated with focusing on value can apply to both. Figure 3-1 demonstrates this overlap.\nThe principle labels are listed here without any specific weighting or order. The principle statements are presented and described in Sections 3.1 through 3.12. Each section begins with a figure that provides the principle label across the top with the principle and key points under the label. Following the figure, each principle is elaborated in the text. The principle labels are:\n▶ Be a diligent, respectful, and caring steward (see Section 3.1).\n▶ Create a collaborative project team environment (see Section 3.2).\n▶ Effectively engage with stakeholders (see Section 3.3).\n▶ Focus on value (see Section 3.4).\n▶ Recognize, evaluate, and respond to system interactions (see Section 3.5).\n▶ Demonstrate leadership behaviors (see Section 3.6).\n▶ Tailor based on context (see Section 3.7).\n▶ Build quality into processes and deliverables (see Section 3.8).\n▶ Navigate complexity (see Section 3.9).\n▶ Optimize risk responses (see Section 3.10).\n▶ Embrace adaptability and resiliency (see Section 3.11).\n▶ Enable change to achieve the envisioned future state (see Section 3.12)."

      "content": "Figure 3-2. Be a Diligent, Respectful, and Caring Steward\nStewardship has slightly different meanings and applications in different contexts. One aspect of stewardship involves being entrusted with the care of something. Another aspect focuses on the responsible planning, use, and management of resources. Yet another aspect means upholding values and ethics.\nStewardship encompasses responsibilities both within and external to the organization. Within the organization, stewardship includes:\n▶ Operating in alignment with the organization, its objectives, strategy, vision, mission, and sustainment of its long-term value;\n▶ Commitment to and respectful engagement of project team members, including their compensation, access to opportunity, and fair treatment;\n▶ Diligent oversight of organizational finances, materials, and other resources used within a project; and\n▶ Understanding the appropriate use of authority, accountability, and responsibility, particularly in leadership positions.\nStewardship outside the organization includes responsibilities in areas such as:\n▶ Environmental sustainability and the organization's use of materials and natural resources;\n▶ Organization's relationship with external stakeholders such as its partners and channels;\n▶ Impact of the organization or project on the market, social community, and regions in which it operates; and\n▶ Advancing the state of practice in professional industries.\nStewardship reflects understanding and acceptance of trust as well as actions and decisions that engender and sustain that trust. Stewards also adhere to both implicit and explicit duties. These can include the following:\n▶ Integrity. Stewards behave honestly and ethically in all engagements and communications. Stewards hold themselves to the highest standards and reflect the values, principles, and behaviors expected of those in their organization. Stewards serve as role models, building trust by living and demonstrating personal and organizational values in their engagements, work activities, and decisions. In the project management context, this duty often requires stewards to challenge team members, peers, and other stakeholders to consider their words and actions; and to be empathetic, self-reflective, and open to feedback.\n▶ Care. Stewards are fiduciaries of the organizational matters in their charge, and they diligently oversee them. Higher-performing projects feature professionals who diligently oversee those matters, beyond the confines of strictly defined responsibilities. Stewards pay close attention and exercise the same level of care over those matters as they would for their personal matters. Care relates to the internal business affairs of the organization. Care for the environment, sustainable use of natural resources, and concern for the conditions of people across the planet should be reflected in the organizational policies and principles.\nProjects bring about changes that may have unanticipated or unwanted consequences. Project practitioners should identify, analyze, and manage the potential downsides of project outcomes so that stakeholders are aware and informed.\nCare includes creating a transparent working environment, open communication channels, and opportunities for stakeholders to raise concerns without penalty or fear of retribution.\n▶ Trustworthiness. Stewards represent themselves, their roles, their project team, and their authority accurately, both inside and outside of the organization. This behavior allows people to understand the degree to which an individual can commit resources, make decisions, or approve something. Trustworthiness also entails individuals proactively identifying conflicts between their personal interests and those of their organization or clients. Such conflicts can undermine trust and confidence, result in unethical or illegal behaviors, create confusion, or contribute to suboptimal outcomes. Stewards protect projects from such breaches of trust.\n▶ Compliance. Stewards comply with laws, rules, regulations, and requirements that are properly authorized within or outside of their organization. However, high-performing projects seek ways to integrate compliance more fully into the project culture, creating more alignment with diverse and potentially conflicting guidelines. Stewards strive for compliance with guidelines intended to protect them, their organization, their stakeholders, and the public at large. In instances where stewards face conflicting guidelines or questions regarding whether or not actions or plans align with established guidelines, stewards seek appropriate counsel and direction.\nStewardship requires leadership with transparency and trustworthiness. Projects affect the lives of the people who deliver them as well as those who are affected by the project deliverables and outcomes. Projects can have effects, such as easing traffic congestion, producing new medications, or creating opportunities for people to interact. Those effects can produce negative impacts and consequences, such as reduced green space, side effects from medications, or disclosure of personal information. Project teams and their organizational leaders carefully consider such factors and impacts so they can make responsible decisions by balancing organizational and project objectives with the larger needs and expectations of global stakeholders.\nIncreasingly, organizations are taking a holistic view to business that considers financial, technical, social, and environmental performance simultaneously instead of sequentially. Since the world is interconnected now more than ever and has finite resources and a shared environment, stewardship decisions have ramifications beyond the project."

      "content": "Figure 3-3. Create a Collaborative Project Team Environment\nCreating a collaborative project team environment involves multiple contributing factors, such as team agreements, structures, and processes. These factors support a culture that enables individuals to work together and provide synergistic effects from interactions.\n▶ Team agreements. Team agreements represent a set of behavioral parameters and working norms established by the project team and upheld through individual and project team commitment. The team agreement should be created at the beginning of a project and will evolve over time as the project team continues to work together and identify norms and behaviors that are necessary in order to continue to work together successfully.\n▶ Organizational structures. Project teams use, tailor, and implement structures that help coordinate the individual effort associated with project work. Organizational structures are any arrangement of or relation between the elements of project work and organizational processes.\nThese structures can be based on roles, functions, or authority. They can be defined as being external to the project, tailored to fit the project context, or newly designed to meet a unique project need. An authority figure may formally impose a structure, or project team members may contribute to its design in alignment with organizational structures.\nExamples of organizational structures that can improve collaboration include, but are not limited to:\n▷ Definitions of roles and responsibilities,\n▷ Allocation of employees and vendors into project teams,\n▷ Formal committees tasked with a specific objective, and\n▷ Standing meetings that regularly review a given topic.\n▶ Processes. Project teams define processes that enable completion of tasks and work assignments. For example, project teams may agree to a decomposition process using a work breakdown structure (WBS), backlog, or task board.\nProject teams are influenced by the culture of the organizations involved in the project, the nature of the project, and the environment in which they operate. Within these influences, project teams establish their own team cultures. Project teams can tailor their structure to best accomplish the project objective.\nBy fostering inclusive and collaborative environments, knowledge and expertise are more freely exchanged, which in turn enable better project outcomes.\nClarity on roles and responsibilities can improve team cultures. Within project teams, specific tasks may be delegated to individuals or selected by project team members themselves. This includes the authority, accountability, and responsibility related to tasks:\n▶ Authority. The condition of having the right, within a given context, to make relevant decisions, establish or improve procedures, apply project resources, expend funds, or give approvals. Authority is conferred from one entity to another, whether done explicitly or implicitly.\n▶ Accountability. The condition of being answerable for an outcome. Accountability is not shared.\n▶ Responsibility. The condition of being obligated to do or fulfill something. Responsibility can be shared.\nRegardless of who is accountable or responsible for specific project work, a collaborative project team takes collective ownership of the project outcomes.\nA diverse project team can enrich the project environment by bringing together different perspectives. The project team can be comprised of internal organizational staff, contracted contributors, volunteers, or external third parties. Additionally, some project team members join the project on a short-term basis to work on a specific deliverable while other members are assigned to the project on a longer-term basis. Integrating these individuals with a project team can challenge everyone involved. A team culture of respect allows for differences and finds ways to leverage them productively, encouraging effective conflict management.\nAnother aspect of a collaborative project team environment is the incorporation of practice standards, ethical codes, and other guidelines that are part of the professional work within the project team and the organization. Project teams consider how these guides can support their efforts to avoid possible conflict among the disciplines and the established guidelines they use.\nA collaborative project team environment fosters the free exchange of information and individual knowledge. This, in turn, increases shared learning and individual development while delivering outcomes. A collaborative project team environment enables everyone to contribute their best efforts to deliver the desired outcomes for an organization. The organization, in turn, will benefit from deliverables and outcomes that respect and enhance its fundamental values, principles, and culture."

      "content": "Figure 3-4. Effectively Engage with Stakeholders\nStakeholders can be individuals, groups, or organizations that may affect, be affected by, or perceive themselves to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a portfolio, program, or project. Stakeholders also directly or indirectly influence a project, its performance, or outcome in either a positive or negative way.\nStakeholders can affect many aspects of a project, including but not limited to:\n▶ Scope/requirements, by revealing the need to add, adjust, or remove elements of the scope and/or project requirements;\n▶ Schedule, by offering ideas to accelerate delivery or by slowing down or stop delivery of key project activities;\n▶ Cost, by helping to reduce or eliminate planned expenditures or by adding steps, requirements, or restrictions that increase cost or require additional resources;\n▶ Project team, by restricting or enabling access to people with the skills, knowledge, and experience needed to deliver the intended outcomes, and promote a learning culture;\n▶ Plans, by providing information for plans or by advocating for changes to agreed activities and work;\n▶ Outcomes, by enabling or blocking work required for the desired outcomes;\n▶ Culture, by establishing or influencing—or even defining—the level and character of engagement of the project team and broader organization;\n▶ Benefits realization, by generating and identifying long-term goals so that the project delivers the intended identified value;\n▶ Risk, by defining the risk thresholds of the project, as well as participating in subsequent risk management activities;\n▶ Quality, by identifying and requiring quality requirements; and\n▶ Success, by defining success factors and participating in the evaluation of success.\nStakeholders may come and go throughout the life cycle of the project. Additionally, the degree of a stakeholder's interest, influence, or impact may change over time. Stakeholders, especially those with a high degree of influence and who have an unfavorable or neutral view about a project, need to be effectively engaged so that their interests, concerns, and rights are understood. The project team can then address these concerns through effective engagement and support leading to the probability of a successful project outcome.\nIdentifying, analyzing, and proactively engaging with stakeholders from the start to the end of the project helps to enable success.\nProject teams are a group of stakeholders. This group of stakeholders engages other stakeholders to understand, consider, communicate, and respond to their interests, needs, and opinions.\nEffective and efficient engagement and communication include determining how, when, how often, and under what circumstances stakeholders want to be—and should be—engaged. Communication is a key part of engagement; however, engagement delves deeper to include awareness of the ideas of others, assimilation of other perspectives, and collective shaping of a shared solution. Engagement includes building and maintaining solid relationships through frequent, two-way communication. It encourages collaboration through interactive meetings, face-to-face meetings, informal dialogue, and knowledge-sharing activities.\nStakeholder engagement relies heavily on interpersonal skills, including taking initiative, integrity, honesty, collaboration, respect, empathy, and confidence. These skills and attitudes can help everyone adapt to the work and to each other, increasing the likelihood of success.\nEngagement helps project teams detect, collect, and evaluate information, data, and opinions. This creates shared understanding and alignment, which enables project outcomes. Additionally, these activities help the project team to tailor the project to identify, adjust, and respond to changing circumstances.\nProject teams actively engage other stakeholders throughout the project to minimize potential negative impacts and maximize positive impacts. Stakeholder engagements also enable opportunities for stronger project performance and outcomes in addition to increasing stakeholder satisfaction. Finally, engaging other stakeholders helps the project team to find solutions that may be more acceptable to a broader range of stakeholders."

      "subsubtopic": "3.4 FOCUS ON VALUE",
      "content": "Figure 3-5. Focus on Value\nValue, including outcomes from the perspective of the customer or end user, is the ultimate success indicator and driver of projects. Value focuses on the outcome of the deliverables. The value of a project may be expressed as a financial contribution to the sponsoring or receiving organization. Value may be a measure of public good achieved, for example, social benefit or the customer's perceived benefit from the project result. When the project is a component of a program, the project's contribution to program outcomes can represent value.\nMany projects, though not all, are initiated based on a business case. Projects may be initiated due to any identified need to deliver or modify a process, product, or service, such as contracts, statements of work, or other documents. In all cases, the project intent is to provide the desired outcome that addresses the need with a valued solution. A business case can contain information about strategic alignment, assessment of risk exposure, economic feasibility study, return on investments, expected key performance measures, evaluations, and alternative approaches. The business case may state the intended value contribution of the project outcome in qualitative or quantitative terms, or both. A business case contains at least these supporting and interrelated elements:\n▶ Business need. Business provides the rationale for the project, explaining why the project is undertaken. It originates with the preliminary business requirements, which are reflected in the project charter or other authorizing document. It provides details about the business goals and objectives. The business need may be intended for the performing organization, a client organization, a partnership of organizations, or public welfare. A clear statement of the business need helps the project team understand the business drivers for the future state and allows the project team to identify opportunities or problems to increase the potential value from the project outcome.\n▶ Project justification. Project justification is connected to business need. It explains why the business need is worth the investment and why it should be addressed at this time. The project justification is accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis and assumptions.\n▶ Business strategy. Business strategy is the reason for the project and all needs are related to the strategy to achieve the value.\nTogether, the business need, project justification, and business strategy, in addition to benefits and possible agreements, provide the project team with information that allows them to make informed decisions to meet or exceed the intended business value.\nDesired outcomes should be clearly described, iteratively assessed, and updated throughout the project. During its life cycle, a project may undergo change and the project team then adapts in response. The project team continuously evaluates project progress and direction against the desired outputs, baselines, and business case to confirm that the project remains aligned to the need and will deliver its intended outcomes. Alternatively, the business case is updated to capture an opportunity or minimize a problem identified by the project team and other stakeholders. If the project or its stakeholders are no longer aligned with the business need or if the project seems unlikely to provide the intended value, the organization may choose to terminate the effort.\nValue is the worth, importance, or usefulness of something. Value is subjective, in the sense that the same concept can have different values for different people and organizations. This occurs because what is considered a benefit depends on organizational strategies, ranging from short-term financial gains, long-term gains, and even nonfinancial elements. Because all projects have a range of stakeholders, different values generated for each group of stakeholders have to be considered and balanced with the whole, while placing a priority on the customer perspective.\nWithin the context of some projects, there may be different forms of value engineering that maximize value to the customer, to the performing organization, or other stakeholders. An example of this includes delivering the required functionality and level of quality with an acceptable risk exposure, while using as few resources as possible, and by avoiding waste. Sometimes, especially in adaptive projects that do not have a fixed, up-front scope, the project team can optimize value by working with the customer to determine which features are worth investment and which may not be valuable enough to be added to the output.\nTo support value realization from projects, project teams shift focus from deliverables to the intended outcomes. Doing so allows project teams to deliver on the vision or purpose of the project, rather than simply creating a specific deliverable. While the deliverable may support the intended project outcome, it may not fully achieve the vision or purpose of the project. For example, customers may want a specific software solution because they think that the solution resolves the business need for higher productivity. The software is the output of the project, but the software itself does not enable the productivity outcome that is intended. In this case, adding a new deliverable of training and coaching on the use of the software can enable a better productivity outcome. If the project's output fails to enable higher productivity, stakeholders may feel that the project has failed. Thus, project teams and other stakeholders understand both the deliverable and the intended outcome from the deliverable.\nThe value contribution of project work could be a short- or long-term measure. Because value contribution may be mixed with contributions from operational activities, it may be difficult to isolate. When the project is a component of a program, evaluation of value at the program level may also be necessary to properly direct the project. A reliable evaluation of value should consider the whole context and the entire life cycle of the project's output. While value is realized over time, effective processes can enable early benefit realization. With efficient and effective implementation, project teams may demonstrate or achieve such outcomes as prioritized delivery, better customer service, or an improved work environment. By working with organizational leaders who are responsible for putting project deliverables into use, project leaders can make sure that the deliverables are positioned to realize the planned outcomes."

      "content": "Figure 3-6. Recognize, Evaluate, and Respond to System Interactions\nA system is a set of interacting and interdependent components that function as a unified whole. Taking a holistic view, a project is a multifaceted entity that exists in dynamic circumstances, exhibiting the characteristics of a system. Project teams should acknowledge this holistic view of a project, seeing the project as a system with its own working parts.\nA project works within other larger systems, and a project deliverable may become part of a larger system to realize benefits. For example, projects may be part of a program which, in turn, may also be part of a portfolio. These interconnected structures are known as a system of systems. Project teams balance inside/out and outside/in perspectives to support alignment across the system of systems.\nThe project may also have subsystems that are required to integrate effectively to deliver the intended outcome. For example, when individual project teams develop separate components of a deliverable, all components should integrate effectively. This requires project teams to interact and align subsystem work on a regular basis.\nSystems thinking also considers timing elements of systems, such as what the project delivers or enables over time. For example, if project deliverables are released incrementally, each increment expands the cumulative outcomes or capabilities of previous versions. Project teams should think beyond the end of the project to the operational state of the project's deliverable, so that intended outcomes are realized.\nAs projects unfold, internal and external conditions are continuously changing. A single change can create several impacts. For example, on a large construction project, a change in requirements can cause contractual changes with the primary contractor, subcontractors, suppliers, or others. In turn, those changes can create an impact on project cost, schedule, scope, and performance. Subsequently, these changes could invoke a change control protocol for obtaining approvals from entities in external systems, such as the service providers, regulators, financiers, and government authorities.\nWhile it is possible to predict some of the changes in advance, many of the changes that can impact the project during its life cycle emerge in real time. With systems thinking, including constant attention to internal and external conditions, the project team can navigate a wide spectrum of changes and impacts to keep the project in agreement with the relevant stakeholders.\nSystems thinking also applies to how the project team views itself and its interactions within the project system. The project system often brings together a diverse project team engaged in working for a common objective. This diversity brings value to project teams, but they need to consider how to leverage those differences effectively, so that the project team works cohesively. For example, if a government agency contracts with a private company for development of a new technology, the development team may consist of project team members from both organizations. Those project team members may have assumptions, ways of working, and mental models related to how they function within their home organization. In this new project system, which combines the cultures of a private company and a government agency, the project team members can establish a synthesized team culture that creates a common vision, language, and toolset. This can help project team members to engage and contribute effectively and help to increase the probability that the project system works.\nBecause of the interactivity among systems, project teams should operate with awareness of, and vigilance toward, changing system dynamics. The following skills support a systems view of the project:\n▶ Empathy with the business areas;\n▶ Critical thinking with a big picture focus;\n▶ Challenging of assumptions and mental models;\n▶ Seeking external review and advice;\n▶ Use of integrated methods, artifacts, and practices so there is a common understanding of project work, deliverables, and outcomes;\n▶ Use of modeling and scenarios to envision how system dynamics may interact and react; and\n▶ Proactive management of the integration to help achieve business outcomes.\nRecognizing, evaluating, and responding to system interactions can lead to the following positive outcomes:\n▶ Early consideration of uncertainty and risk within the project, exploration of alternatives, and consideration of unintended consequences;\n▶ Ability to adjust assumptions and plans throughout the project life cycle;\n▶ Provision of ongoing information and insights that inform planning and delivery;\n▶ Clear communication of plans, progress, and projections to relevant stakeholders;\n▶ Alignment of project goals and objectives to the customer organization's goals, objectives, and vision;\n▶ Ability to adjust to the changing needs of the end user, sponsor, or customer of the project deliverables;\n▶ Ability to see synergies and savings between aligned projects or initiatives;\n▶ Ability to exploit opportunities not otherwise captured or see threats posed to or by other projects or initiatives;\n▶ Clarity regarding the best project performance measurement and their influence on the behavior of the people involved in the project;\n▶ Decisions that benefit the organization as a whole; and\n▶ More comprehensive and informed identification of risks."

      "subsubtopic": "3.6 DEMONSTRATE LEADERSHIP BEHAVIORS",
      "content": "Figure 3-7. Demonstrate Leadership Behaviors\nProjects create a unique need for effective leadership. Unlike general business operations, where roles and responsibilities are often established and consistent, projects often involve multiple organizations, departments, functions, or vendors that do not interact on a regular basis. Moreover, projects may carry higher stakes and expectations than regular operational functions. As a result, a broader array of managers, executives, senior contributors, and other stakeholders attempt to influence a project. This often creates higher degrees of confusion and conflict. Consequently, higher performing projects demonstrate effective leadership behaviors more frequently, and from more people than most projects.\nA project environment that prioritizes vision, creativity, motivation, enthusiasm, encouragement, and empathy can support better outcomes. These traits are often associated with leadership. Leadership comprises the attitude, talent, character, and behaviors to influence individuals within and outside the project team toward the desired outcomes.\nLeadership is not exclusive to any specific role. High-performing projects may feature multiple people exhibiting effective leadership skills, for example, the project manager, sponsors, stakeholders, senior management, or even project team members. Anyone working on a project can demonstrate effective leadership traits, styles, and skills to help the project team perform and deliver the required results.\nIt is important to note that more conflict and confusion can emerge when too many participants attempt to exert project influence in multiple, misaligned directions. However, higher-performing projects show a paradoxical combination of more influencers, each contributing more leadership skills in a complementary fashion. For example: if a sponsor articulates clear priorities, then a technical lead opens the discussion for delivery options, where individual contributors assert pros and cons until the project manager brings the conversation to a consensus strategy. Successful leadership enables someone to influence, motivate, direct, and coach people under any condition. It also incorporates characteristics derived from an organization's culture and practices.\nLeadership should not be confused with authority, which is the position of control given to individuals within an organization to foster overall effective and efficient function. Authority is the right to exercise power. Authority is usually delegated to a person by formal means such as a charter document or designated title. This person may then have a role or position description that indicates their authority. Authority denotes accountability for certain activities, actions of individuals, or decision making in certain circumstances. While individuals may use their authority to influence, motivate, direct others, or act when others do not perform or act as directed or requested, this is not the same as leadership. For example, organizational executives may grant someone the authority to form a project team to deliver an outcome. However, authority alone is insufficient. It takes leadership to motivate a group toward a common goal, influence them to align their individual interests in favor of collective effort, and achieve success as a project team rather than as individuals.\nEffective leadership draws from or combines elements of various styles of leadership. Documented leadership styles range from autocratic, democratic, laissez-faire, directive, participative, assertive, supportive, and autocratic to consensus. Of all these, no single leadership style has proven to be the universally best or recommended approach. Instead, effective leadership is shown when it best fits a given situation. For example:\n▶ In moments of chaos, directive action creates more clarity and momentum than collaborative problem solving.\n▶ For environments with highly competent and engaged staff, empowered delegation elicits more productivity than centralized coordination.\nWhen senior managers suffer conflict over priorities, neutral facilitation helps more than detailed recommendations. Effective leadership skill is grown. It can be learned and developed so that it becomes a professional asset to the individual, as well as a benefit to the project and its stakeholders. High-performing projects show a pervasive pattern of continuous improvement down to the personal level. A project team member deepens leadership acumen by adding or practicing a combination of various skills or techniques, including but not limited to:\n▶ Focusing a project team around agreed goals,\n▶ Articulating a motivating vision for the project outcomes,\n▶ Seeking resources and support for the project,\n▶ Generating consensus on the best way forward,\n▶ Overcoming obstacles to project progress,\n▶ Negotiating and resolving conflict within the project team and between the project team and other stakeholders,\n▶ Adapting communication style and messaging so that they are relevant to the audience,\n▶ Coaching and mentoring fellow project team members,\n▶ Appreciating and rewarding positive behaviors and contributions,\n▶ Providing opportunities for skill growth and development,\n▶ Facilitating collaborative decision making,\n▶ Employing effective conversations and active listening,\n▶ Empowering project team members and delegating responsibilities to them,\n▶ Building a cohesive project team that takes responsibility,\n▶ Showing empathy for project team and stakeholder perspectives,\n▶ Having self-awareness of one's own bias and behaviors,\n▶ Managing and adapting to change during the project life cycle,\n▶ Facilitating a fail-fast/learn quickly mindset by acknowledging mistakes, and\n▶ Role modeling of desired behaviors.\nPersonal character matters in a leader. A person may have strong ability in leadership skills but then have their influence undermined by the perception of being self-serving or untrustworthy. Effective leaders seek to be a role model in areas of honesty, integrity, and ethical conduct. Effective leaders focus on being transparent, behave unselfishly, and are able to ask for help. Effective leaders understand that project team members scrutinize and emulate the values, ethics, and behaviors that leaders exhibit. Therefore, leaders have an additional responsibility to demonstrate expected behaviors through their actions.\nProjects work best when leaders understand what motivates people. Project teams can thrive when project team members use appropriate leadership traits, skills, and characteristics that match the specific needs and expectations of stakeholders. Knowing how to best communicate with or motivate people, or take action when required, can help improve project team performance and manage obstacles to project success. When practiced by more than one person on a project, leadership can foster shared responsibility toward the project goal, which in turn can foster a healthy and vibrant environment. Motivators include such forces as finances, recognition, autonomy, compelling purpose, growth opportunity, and personal contribution.\nEffective leadership promotes project success and contributes to positive project outcomes. Project teams, individual project team members, and other stakeholders are engaged throughout a well-led project. Each project team member can focus on delivering results using a common vision and working toward shared outcomes. Effective leadership is essential in helping project teams maintain an ethical and adaptable environment.\nAdditionally, business obligations can be fulfilled based on delegated responsibility and authority. Shared leadership does not undermine or diminish the role or authority of a leader designated by the organization, nor does it diminish the need for that leader to apply the right leadership style and skills at the right time.\nBy blending styles, continuing skill growth, and leveraging motivators, any project team member or stakeholder can motivate, influence, coach, and grow the project team, regardless of role or position."

Tailoring aims to maximize value, manage constraints, and improve performance by using “just enough” processes, methods, templates, and artifacts to achieve the desired outcome from the project.\nTogether with the PMO and considering governance, project teams discuss and decide on the delivery approach and resources required for producing outcomes on a project-by-project basis. This includes the selection of the processes to use, development approach, methods, and artifacts needed to deliver the project outcomes. Tailoring decisions can be an implicit action of accepting an established methodology. Conversely, tailoring can be an explicit action of selecting and mixing specific elements to suit the unique characteristics of the project and the project environment.\nTailoring is necessary to some degree in every project, because each project exists in a particular context.\nProjects are often unique, even when the deliverable of the project does not seem unique. This is because project contexts differ in that the organization, its customers, its channels, and its environment are dynamic elements. Those changes and ongoing learning may cause project teams to use or develop different methods or approaches in pursuit of success. The project team should examine the unique set of conditions for each project, so that they can determine the most appropriate methods of producing the desired outcomes.\nAn existing methodology or common way of working can inform the way in which a project is tailored. A methodology is a system of practices, techniques, procedures, and rules used by those who work in a discipline. Project teams may be required to assume the methodology of the parent organization. That is, the project team adopts a system of processes, governance, methods, and templates that provide guidance on how to run the project. While this provides a degree of consistency to projects within an organization, the methodology itself may still need tailoring to suit each project. Organizational policies and procedures prescribe authorized boundaries within which the project team can tailor.\nProject teams can also factor in the time and cost of project management processes. Processes that are not tailored may add little value to the project or its outcomes while increasing cost and lengthening schedule. Tailoring the approach along with appropriate processes, methods, and artifacts can help project teams make decisions about process-related costs and the related value contribution to project outcomes.\nIn addition to deciding on how to tailor an approach, project teams communicate the tailoring decisions to stakeholders associated with that approach. Each member of the project team is aware of the chosen methods and processes that relate to those stakeholders and their role.\nTailoring the project approach to suit the unique characteristics of the project and its environment can contribute to a higher level of project performance and an increased probability of success. A tailored project approach can produce direct and indirect benefits to organizations, such as:\n▶ Deeper commitment from project team members because they took part in defining the approach,\n▶ Reduction in waste in terms of actions or resources,\n▶ Customer-oriented focus, as the needs of the customer and other stakeholders are an important influencing factor in the tailoring of the project, and\n▶ More efficient use of project resources, as project teams are conscious of the weight of project processes.\nTailoring projects can lead to the following positive outcomes:\n▶ Increased innovation, efficiency, and productivity;\n▶ Lessons learned, so that improvements from a specific delivery approach can be shared and applied to the next round of work or future projects;\n▶ Further improvement of an organization's methodology, with new practices, methods, and artifacts;\n▶ Discovery of improved outcomes, processes, or methods through experimentation;\n▶ Effective integration within multidisciplinary project teams of methods and practices used to deliver project results; and\n▶ Increased adaptability for the organization in the long term.\nTailoring an approach is iterative in nature, and therefore is a constant process itself during the project life cycle. Project teams collect feedback from all stakeholders on how the methods and tailored processes are working for them as the project progresses to evaluate their effectiveness and add value to the organization."

      "content": "Figure 3-9. Build Quality into Processes and Deliverables\nQuality is the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics of a product, service, or result fulfills the requirements. Quality includes the ability to satisfy the customer's stated or implied needs. The product, service, or result of a project (referred to here as deliverables) is measured for the quality of both the conformance to acceptance criteria and fitness for use.\nQuality may have several different dimensions, including but not limited to the following:\n▶ Performance. Does the deliverable function as the project team and other stakeholders intended?\n▶ Conformity. Is the deliverable fit for use, and does it meet the specifications?\n▶ Reliability. Does the deliverable produce consistent metrics each time it is performed or produced?\n▶ Resilience. Is the deliverable able to cope with unforeseen failures and quickly recover?\n▶ Satisfaction. Does the deliverable elicit positive feedback from end users? This includes usability and user experience?\n▶ Uniformity. Does the deliverable show parity with other deliverables produced in the same manner?\n▶ Efficiency. Does the deliverable produce the greatest output with the least amount of inputs and effort?\n▶ Sustainability. Does the deliverable produce a positive impact on economic, social, and environmental parameters?\nProject teams measure quality using metrics and acceptance criteria based on requirements. A requirement is a condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy a need. Requirements, either explicit or implicit, may come from stakeholders, a contract, organizational policies, standards, or regulatory bodies, or a combination of these. Quality is closely linked to the product acceptance criteria, as described in the statement of work or other design documents. These criteria should be updated as experimentation and prioritization occur and validated as part of the acceptance process.\nQuality is also relevant to the project approaches and activities used to produce the project's deliverables. While project teams evaluate the quality of a deliverable through inspection and testing, project activities and processes are assessed through reviews and audits. In both instances, quality activities may focus on detection and prevention of errors and defects.\nThe objective of quality activities is to help ensure that what is delivered meets the objectives of the customer and other relevant stakeholders in the most straightforward path. The intention is to minimize the waste of resources and maximize the probability of attaining the desired outcome. This results in:\n▶ Moving the deliverables to the point of delivery quickly, and\n▶ Preventing defects in the deliverables or identifying them early to avoid or reduce the need for rework and scrap.\nThe objective of quality activities is the same whether dealing with an up-front, well-defined set of requirements or a set of requirements that are progressively elaborated and incrementally delivered.\nQuality management processes and practices help produce deliverables and outcomes that meet project objectives and align to the expectations, uses, and acceptance criteria expressed by the organization and relevant stakeholders. Close attention to quality in project processes and deliverables creates positive outcomes, including:\n▶ Project deliverables that are fit for purpose, as defined by acceptance criteria,\n▶ Project deliverables that meet stakeholder expectations and business objectives,\n▶ Project deliverables with minimal or no defects,\n▶ Timely or expedited delivery,\n▶ Enhanced cost control,\n▶ Increased quality of product delivery,\n▶ Reduced rework and scrap,\n▶ Reduced customer complaints,\n▶ Good supply chain integration,\n▶ Improved productivity,\n▶ Increased project team morale and satisfaction,\n▶ Robust service delivery,\n▶ Improved decision making, and\n▶ Continually improved processes."

      "content": "Figure 3-10. Navigate Complexity\nA project is a system of elements that interact with each other. Complexity is a characteristic of a project or its environment that is difficult to manage due to human behavior, system behavior, and ambiguity. The nature and number of the interactions determine the degree of complexity in a project. Complexity emerges from project elements, interactions between project elements, and interactions with other systems and the project environment. Though complexity cannot be controlled, project teams can modify their activities to address impacts that occur as a result of complexity.\nProject teams often cannot foresee complexity emerging because it is the result of many interactions such as risks, dependencies, events, or relationships. Alternatively, a few causes may converge to produce a single complex effect, which makes isolating a specific cause of complexity difficult.\nProject complexity occurs as the result of individual elements within the project and project system as a whole. For example, complexity within a project may be amplified with a greater number or diversity of stakeholders, such as regulatory agencies, international financial institutions, multiple vendors, numerous specialty subcontractors, or local communities. These stakeholders can have a significant impact on the complexity of a project, both individually and collectively.\nSome of the more common sources of complexity are:\n▶ Human behavior. Human behavior is the interplay of conduct, demeanors, attitudes, and experience of people. Human behavior can also contribute to complexity by introducing elements of subjectivity such as personal agendas that conflict with the project's goals and objectives. Stakeholders located in remote locations may have different time zones, speak different languages, and have different cultural norms.\n▶ System behavior. System behavior is the result of dynamic interdependencies within and among project elements. For example, the integration of different technology systems may cause threats that could impact project outcomes and success. The interactions among components of the project system may lead to interconnected risk, create emerging or unforeseeable issues, and produce unclear and disproportional cause-and-effect relationships.\n▶ Uncertainty and ambiguity. Ambiguity is a state of being unclear, of not knowing what to expect or how to comprehend a situation. Ambiguity can arise from having many options or a lack of clarity on the optimal choice. Unclear or misleading events, emerging issues, or subjective situations can also lead to ambiguity.\nUncertainty is the lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, or solutions to pursue. Uncertainty deals with the probabilities of alternative actions, reactions, and outcomes. Uncertainty includes unknown unknowns and black swans, which are emerging factors that are completely outside of existing knowledge or experience.\nWithin a complex environment, uncertainty and ambiguity can combine to blur causal relationships to the point where probabilities and impacts are ill defined. It becomes difficult to reduce uncertainty and ambiguity to the point where relationships can be well defined and therefore addressed effectively.\n▶ Technological innovation. Technological innovation can cause disruption to products, services, ways of working, processes, tools, techniques, procedures, and more. The introduction of desktop computing and social media are examples of technological innovations that have fundamentally changed the way project work is performed. New technology, along with the uncertainty of how that technology will be used, contributes to complexity. Innovation has the potential to help move projects toward a solution, or to disrupt the project when associated uncertainties are not defined, leading to increased complexity.\nComplexity may emerge and impact the project in any area and at any point in the project life cycle. Project teams can identify elements of complexity throughout the project by continually looking at the project component as well as the project as a whole for signs of complexity. Knowledge of systems thinking, complex adaptive systems, experience from past project work, experimentation, and continuous learning related to system interaction leads to the project team's increased ability to navigate complexity when it emerges. Being vigilant for indications of complexity allows project teams to adapt their approaches and plans to navigate potential disruption to effective project delivery."

      "content": "Figure 3-11. Optimize Risk Responses\nA risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, can have a positive or negative effect on one or more objectives. Identified risks may or may not materialize in a project. Project teams endeavor to identify and evaluate known and emergent risks, both internal and external to the project, throughout the life cycle.\nProject teams seek to maximize positive risks (opportunities) and decrease exposure to negative risks (threats). Threats may result in issues such as delay, cost overrun, technical failure, performance shortfall, or loss of reputation. Opportunities can lead to benefits such as reduced time and cost, improved performance, increased market share, or enhanced reputation.\nProject teams also monitor the overall project risk. Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall risk arises from all sources of uncertainty, including individual risks, and represents the exposure of the stakeholders to the implications of variations in project outcome, both positive and negative. Management of overall project risk aims to keep project risk exposure within an acceptable range. Management strategies include reducing drivers of threats, promoting drivers of opportunities, and maximizing the probability of achieving overall project objectives.\nProject team members engage with relevant stakeholders to understand their risk appetite and risk thresholds. Risk appetite describes the degree of uncertainty an organization or individual is willing to accept in anticipation of a reward. Risk threshold is the measure of acceptable variation around an objective that reflects the risk appetite of the organization and stakeholders. The risk threshold reflects the risk appetite. Therefore, a risk threshold of ±5% around a cost objective reflects a lower risk appetite than a risk threshold of ±10%. The risk appetite and risk threshold inform how the project team navigates risk in a project.\nEffective and appropriate risk responses can reduce individual and overall project threats and increase individual and overall opportunities. Project teams should consistently identify potential risk responses with the following characteristics in mind:\n▶ Appropriate and timely to the significance of the risk,\n▶ Cost effective,\n▶ Realistic within the project context,\n▶ Agreed to by relevant stakeholders, and\n▶ Owned by a responsible person.\nRisks can exist within the enterprise, portfolio, program, project, and product. The project may be a component of a program in which the risk can potentially enhance or diminish benefits realization and, therefore, value. The project may be a component of a portfolio of related or unrelated work in which the risk can potentially enhance or diminish overall value of the portfolio and realization of business objectives.\nOrganizations and project teams that employ consistent risk evaluation, planning, and proactive risk implementation often find the effort to be less costly than reacting to issues when the risk materializes.\nMore information on risk management may be found in The Standard for Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects [3]."

      "content": "Figure 3-12. Embrace Adaptability and Resiliency\nMost projects encounter challenges or obstacles at some stage. The combined attributes of adaptability and resiliency in the project team's approach to a project help the project accommodate impacts and thrive. Adaptability refers to the ability to respond to changing conditions. Resiliency consists of two complementary traits: the ability to absorb impacts and the ability to recover quickly from a setback or failure. Both adaptability and resiliency are helpful characteristics for anyone working on projects.\nA project rarely performs exactly as initially planned. Projects are influenced by internal and external factors—new requirements, issues, stakeholder influences, among other factors—which exist in a system of interactions. Some elements within a project may fail or fall short of expectations, requiring the project team to regroup, rethink, and replan. On an infrastructure project, for example, a court decision during project execution could change the designs and plans. In a technology project, a computerized model of the technology might show that the components work together properly, but the real-world application fails. In both cases, the project team will need to address the situation in order to move the project forward. The view that projects should hold firm to plans and commitments made during the early stages, even after new or unforeseen factors emerge, is not beneficial to stakeholders, including customers and end users, as this limits the potential for generating value. However, adapting should be done with a holistic view, such as a proper change control process, to avoid problems such as scope creep. In a project environment, capabilities that support adaptability and resilience include:\n▶ Short feedback loops to adapt quickly;\n▶ Continuous learning and improvement;\n▶ Project teams with broad skill sets, coupled with individuals having extensive knowledge in each required skill area;\n▶ Regular inspection and adaptation of project work to identify improvement opportunities;\n▶ Diverse project teams to capture a broad range of experiences;\n▶ Open and transparent planning that engages internal and external stakeholders;\n▶ Small-scale prototypes and experiments to test ideas and try new approaches;\n▶ Ability to leverage new ways of thinking and working;\n▶ Process design that balances velocity of work and stability of requirements;\n▶ Open organizational conversations;\n▶ Diverse project teams with broad skill sets, cultures, and experience, coupled with subject matter experts in each required skill area;\n▶ Understanding from past learning of the same or similar endeavors;\n▶ Ability and willingness to anticipate multiple potential scenarios and prepare for multiple eventualities;\n▶ Deferring decision making to the last responsible moment;\n▶ Management support; and\n▶ Open-ended design that balances speed and stability.\nEnvisioning outcomes rather than deliverables can enable solutions, harnessing a better result than the one originally planned. For example, a project team may find an alternative solution that would provide stronger outcomes than the original defined deliverable. While exploration of alternatives is usually the purview of the business case, technologies and other capabilities are evolving so rapidly that a solution could emerge at any time between completion of the business case and project closure. Opportunities for adaptation may emerge during a project, at which time the project team should make a case to the project sponsor, product owner, or customer for capturing the opportunity. Depending on the type of contract, the customer's approval may be needed for some of the changes that result from the adaptation. The project team should be prepared to adapt its plans and activities to take advantage of the opportunity, with the support of the project sponsor, product owner, or customer.\nUnexpected changes and circumstances in a project system can also present opportunities. To optimize value delivery, project teams should use problem solving as well as a holistic-thinking approach to changes and unplanned events. When an unplanned event occurs, project teams should look for potential positive outcomes that might be gained. For example, incorporating a change that occurs late in a project time line could add competitive advantage by being the first product in the market to offer the feature.\nBuilding adaptability and resiliency in a project keeps project teams focused on the desired outcome when internal and external factors change, and it helps them recover from setbacks. These characteristics also help project teams learn and improve so that they can quickly recover from failures or setbacks and continue making progress toward delivering value."

      "content": "Figure 3-13. Enable Change to Achieve the Envisioned Future State\nRemaining relevant in today's business environment is a fundamental challenge for all organizations. Relevance entails being responsive to stakeholder needs and desires. This requires continually evaluating offerings for the benefit of stakeholders, rapidly responding to changes, and acting as agents for change. Project managers are uniquely poised to keep an organization prepared for changes. Projects, by their very definition, create something new: they are agents of change.\nChange management, or enablement, is a comprehensive, cyclic, and structured approach for transitioning individuals, groups, and organizations from a current state to a future state in which they realize desired benefits. It is different from project change control, which is a process whereby modifications to documents, deliverables, or baselines associated with the project are identified and documented, and then are approved or rejected.\nChange in an organization can originate from internal sources, such as the need for a new capability or in response to a performance gap. Change can also originate from external sources such as technological advances, demographic changes, or socioeconomic pressures. Any type of change involves some level of adaptability or assimilation by the group experiencing the change as well as the industries with which the group interacts.\nChange may be implemented by and have consequences for stakeholders. Enabling stakeholder change is part of facilitating the project to provide the required deliverable as well as the intended outcome.\nEnabling change in an organization can be challenging. Some people may seem inherently resistant to change or risk averse, and environments may display a conservative culture, among other reasons. Effective change management uses a motivational strategy rather than a forceful one. Engagement and two-way communication create an environment in which adoption and assimilation of change can occur or identify some valid concerns from the resistant users that may need to be addressed.\nProject team members and project managers can work with relevant stakeholders to address resistance, fatigue, and change absorption to increase the probability that change will be adopted or assimilated successfully by customers or recipients of project deliverables. This includes communicating the vision and goals associated with the change early in the project to achieve buy-in for the change. The benefits of the change and the impact on work processes should be communicated to all levels of the organization throughout the project.\nIt is also important to adapt the speed of change to the change appetite, cost, and ability of the stakeholders and the environment to assimilate change. Attempting to create too many changes in too short a time can lead to resistance because of change saturation. Even when stakeholders unanimously agree that change will produce more value or enhance outcomes, they often still have difficulty working through the actions that will deliver enhanced benefits. To foster benefits realization, the project may also include activities to reinforce the change after its implementation in order to avoid people returning to the initial state.\nRecognizing and addressing the needs of stakeholders to embrace change throughout the project life cycle helps to integrate the resulting change in the project work, making a successful outcome more likely.\nMore information on organizational change management may be found in Managing Change in Organizations: A Practice Guide [4]."

There are eight project performance domains in this guide.\nTailoring is the deliberate adaptation of the project management approach, governance, and processes to make them more suitable for the given environment and the work at hand. The tailoring process is driven by the guiding project management principles, organizational values, and organizational culture.\nIn embracing the full spectrum of project approaches, this edition of the PMBOK® Guide recognizes that no publication can capture every tool, technique, or practice that project teams might use.

These areas of focus are not addressed as siloed efforts because they overlap and interconnect.

      "content": "The following definitions are relevant to the Stakeholder Performance Domain:\nStakeholder. An individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project, program, or portfolio.\nStakeholder Analysis. A method of systematically gathering and analyzing quantitative and qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account throughout the project.\nProjects are performed by people and for people. This performance domain entails working with stakeholders to maintain alignment and engaging with them to foster positive relationships and satisfaction.\nStakeholders include individuals, groups, and organizations (see Figure 2-2). A project can have a small group of stakeholders or potentially millions of stakeholders. There may be different stakeholders in different phases of the project, and the influence, power, or interests of stakeholders may change as the project unfolds.\nEffective stakeholder identification, analysis, and engagement includes stakeholders who are internal and external to the organization, those who are supportive of the project, and those who may not be supportive or are neutral. While having relevant technical project management skills is an important aspect of successful projects, having the interpersonal and leadership skills to work effectively with stakeholders is just as important, if not more so.\n2.1.1 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT\nStakeholder engagement includes implementing strategies and actions to promote productive involvement of stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement activities start before or when the project starts and continue throughout the project.\n2.1.1.1 Identify\nHigh-level stakeholder identification may be carried out prior to forming the project team. Detailed stakeholder identification progressively elaborates the initial work and is a continuous activity throughout the project. Some stakeholders are easy to identify, such as the customer, sponsor, project team, end users, and so forth, but others can be difficult to identify when they are not directly connected to the project.\n2.1.1.2 Understand and Analyze\nOnce stakeholders are identified, the project manager and the project team should seek to understand stakeholders’ feelings, emotions, beliefs, and values. These elements can lead to additional threats or opportunities for the project outcomes. They can also change quickly, and as such, understanding and analyzing stakeholders is an ongoing action.\nRelated to understanding the project stakeholders is the need to analyze aspects of each stakeholder's position on and perspective of the project. Analyzing stakeholders considers several stakeholder aspects, such as:\n▶ Power,\n▶ Impact,\n▶ Attitude,\n▶ Beliefs,\n▶ Expectations,\n▶ Degree of influence,\n▶ Proximity to the project,\n▶ Interest in the project, and\n▶ Other aspects surrounding stakeholder interaction with the project.\nThis information helps the project team consider interactions that may influence the motivations, actions, and behaviors of stakeholders. In addition to individual analysis, the project team should consider how stakeholders interact with each other, as they often form alliances that help or hinder the project's objectives. For example, if the project team believes a key business manager is highly influential but has negative perceptions related to the project, they can explore how to detect the business manager's perceptions and respond appropriately as the project unfolds. In all cases, the analysis work should be held in confidence by the project team since the information could be misinterpreted outside the context for the analysis.\n2.1.1.3 Prioritize\nOn many projects, there are too many stakeholders involved for the project team to engage directly or effectively with all of them. Based on its analysis, the project team can complete an initial prioritization of stakeholders. It is common to focus on stakeholders with the most power and interest as one way to prioritize engagement. As events unfold throughout the project, the project team may need to reprioritize based on new stakeholders or evolving changes in the stakeholder landscape.\n2.1.1.4 Engage\nStakeholder engagement entails working collaboratively with stakeholders to introduce the project, elicit their requirements, manage expectations, resolve issues, negotiate, prioritize, problem solve, and make decisions. Engaging stakeholders requires the application of soft skills, such as active listening, interpersonal skills, and conflict management, as well as leadership skills such as establishing the vision and critical thinking.\nCommunication with stakeholders can take place via written or verbal means, and it can be formal or informal. Examples of each type of communication are shown in Table 2-1.\nCommunication methods include push, pull, and interactive communication:\n▶ Push. Communication sent to stakeholders such as memos, emails, status reports, voice mail, and so forth. Push communication is used for one-way communications with individual stakeholders or groups of stakeholders. Push communication inhibits the ability to immediately gauge reaction and assess understanding; therefore, it should be used deliberately.\n▶ Pull. Information sought by the stakeholder, such as a project team member going to an intranet to find communication policies or templates, running internet searches, and using online repositories. Pulling information is used for indirect sensing of stakeholder concerns.\nEngagement goes deeper than pushing or pulling communication. Engagement is interactive. It includes an exchange of information with one or more stakeholders such as conversations, phone calls, meetings, brainstorming, product demos, and the like.\nWith all forms of communication, quick feedback loops provide useful information to:\n▶ Confirm the degree to which the stakeholder(s) heard the message.\n▶ Determine if stakeholders agree with the message.\n▶ Identify nuanced or other unintended messages the recipient detected.\n▶ Gain other helpful insights.\n2.1.1.5 Monitor\nThroughout the project, stakeholders will change as new stakeholders are identified and others cease to be stakeholders. As the project progresses, the attitude or power of some stakeholders may change. In addition to identifying and analyzing new stakeholders, there is an opportunity to assess whether the current engagement strategy is effective or if it needs to be adjusted. Therefore, the amount and effectiveness of stakeholder engagement is monitored throughout the project.\nThe degree of stakeholder satisfaction can often be determined by having a conversation with stakeholders to gauge their satisfaction with the project deliverables and the overall management of the project. Project and iteration reviews, product reviews, stage gates, and other methods are ways to obtain periodic feedback. For large groups of stakeholders, a survey can be used to assess the degree of satisfaction. Where necessary, the stakeholder engagement approach can be updated to achieve higher stakeholder satisfaction.\n2.1.2 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nStakeholders permeate all aspects of the project. They define and prioritize the requirements and scope for the project team. They participate in and shape the planning. They determine acceptance and quality criteria for the project deliverables and outcomes. Much of the project work is around engaging and communicating with stakeholders. Throughout the project or at its closure, they use the project deliverables and influence the realization of project outcomes.\nSome stakeholders can assist in lowering the amount of uncertainty present on a project while others may cause an increase in uncertainty. Stakeholders such as customers, senior management, project management office leads, or program managers will focus on measures of performance for the project and its deliverables. These interactions are samples of how the Stakeholder Performance Domain integrates and interweaves with other performance domains, though they are not inclusive of all the ways stakeholder concerns interact throughout the performance domains.\n2.1.3 CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-2 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right."

      "content": "This performance domain entails establishing the culture and environment that enables a collection of diverse individuals to evolve into a high-performing project team. This includes recognizing the activities needed to foster project team development and encouraging leadership behaviors from all project team members.\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Team Performance Domain:\nProject Manager. The person assigned by the performing organization to lead the project team that is responsible for achieving the project objectives.\nProject Management Team. The members of the project team who are directly involved in project management activities.\nProject Team. A set of individuals performing the work of the project to achieve its objectives.\n2.2.1 PROJECT TEAM MANAGEMENT AND LEADERSHIP\nProject management entails applying knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques for management activities as well as leadership activities. Management activities focus on the means of meeting project objectives, such as having effective processes, planning, coordinating, measuring, and monitoring work, among others. Leadership activities focus on people. Leadership includes influencing, motivating, listening, enabling, and other activities having to do with the project team. Both are important in delivering the intended outcomes.\n2.2.1.1 Centralized Management and Leadership\nWhile leadership activities should be practiced by all project team members, management activities may be centralized or distributed. In an environment where management activities are centralized, accountability (being answerable for an outcome), is usually assigned to one individual, such as the project manager or similar role. In these situations, a project charter or other authorizing document can provide approval for the project manager to form a project team to achieve the project outcomes.\n2.2.1.2 Distributed Management and Leadership\nSometimes project management activities are shared among a project management team, and project team members are responsible for completing the work. There are also situations where a project team may self-organize to complete a project. Rather than having a designated project manager, someone within the project team may serve as facilitator to enable communication, collaboration, and engagement. This role may shift among project team members.\nServant leadership is a style of leadership that focuses on understanding and addressing the needs and development of project team members in order to enable the highest possible project team performance. Servant leaders place emphasis on developing project team members to their highest potential by focusing on addressing questions, such as:\n▶ Are project team members growing as individuals?\n▶ Are project team members becoming healthier, wiser, freer, and more autonomous?\n▶ Are project team members more likely to become servant leaders?\nServant leaders allow project teams to self-organize when possible and increase levels of autonomy by passing appropriate decision-making opportunities to project team members. Servant leadership behaviors include:\n▶ Obstacle removal. Since it is the project team who generates the majority of business value, a critical role for the servant leader is to maximize delivery by removing impediments to their progress. This includes solving problems and removing obstacles that may be hampering the project team's work. By solving or easing these impediments, the project team can deliver value to the business faster.\n▶ Diversion shield. Servant leaders protect the project team from internal and external diversions that redirect the project team from the current objectives. Time fragmentation reduces productivity, so shielding the project team from noncritical, external demands helps the project team stay focused.\n▶ Encouragement and development opportunities. The servant leader also provides tools and encouragement to keep the project team satisfied and productive. Learning what motivates project team members as individuals and finding ways to reward them for good work helps keep project team members satisfied.\n2.2.1.3 Common Aspects of Team Development\nRegardless of how the management activities are structured, there are common aspects of project team development that are relevant for most project teams. These include:\n▶ Vision and objectives. It is essential that everyone is aware of the project vision and objectives. The vision and objectives are communicated throughout the project. This includes referencing the intended outcomes when the project team is engaged in making decisions and solving problems.\n▶ Roles and responsibilities. It is important to make sure project team members understand and fulfill their roles and responsibilities. This can include identifying gaps in knowledge and skills as well as strategies to address those gaps through training, mentoring, or coaching.\n▶ Project team operations. Facilitating project team communication, problem solving, and the process of coming to consensus may include working with the project team to develop a project team charter and a set of operating guidelines or project team norms.\n▶ Guidance. Guidance can be directed to the overall project team to keep everyone headed in the right direction. Individual project team members may also provide guidance on a particular task or deliverable.\n▶ Growth. Identifying areas where the project team is performing well and pointing out areas where the project team can improve helps the project team to grow. Working collaboratively, the project team can identify goals for its improvement and take steps to meet those goals. This also applies to each individual on the project team. Individuals may want to grow their skills and experience in certain areas, and the project manager can assist with that.\nThere are several models that describe the stages of project team growth included in Section 4.\nWhen project teams form across different organizations based on a contract, strategic partnership, or other business relationship, specific roles that perform various functions may be more formalized and less flexible depending on the contract or other terms. Such arrangements often require more up-front work to establish a “one team” mindset, ensure project team members understand how everyone contributes to the project, and establish other enablers that integrate skills, capabilities, and processes.\n2.2.2 PROJECT TEAM CULTURE\nEach project team develops its own team culture. The project team's culture may be established deliberately by developing project team norms, or informally through the behaviors and actions of its project team members. The project team culture operates within the organization's culture but reflects the project team's individual ways of working and interacting.\nHuman beings have a set of biases, some of them unconscious and some of them conscious. For example, one person may feel that unless a schedule is displayed using a software-generated Gantt chart, that it is not a true or valid schedule. Another person may have a contrasting bias that detailed planning any further out than 30 days is a waste of time. Being open and transparent about biases up front establishes a culture of openness and trust that can enable consensus and collaboration.\nThe project manager is key in establishing and maintaining a safe, respectful, nonjudgmental environment that allows the project team to communicate openly. One way to accomplish this is by modeling desired behaviors, such as:\n▶ Transparency. Being transparent in how one thinks, makes choices, and processes information helps others identify and share their own processes. This can extend to being transparent about biases as well.\n▶ Integrity. Integrity is comprised of ethical behavior and honesty. Individuals demonstrate honesty by surfacing risks, communicating their assumptions and basis of estimates, delivering bad news early, ensuring status reports provide an accurate depiction of the project's status, and in many other ways. Ethical behavior can include surfacing potential defects or negative effects in product design, disclosing potential conflicts of interest, ensuring fairness, and making decisions based on environmental, stakeholder, and financial impacts.\n▶ Respect. Demonstrating respect for each person, how the person thinks, the person's skills, and the perspective and expertise the person brings to the project team sets the stage for all project team members to adopt this behavior.\n▶ Positive discourse. Throughout the project, diverse opinions, different ways of approaching situations, and misunderstandings will occur. These are a normal part of conducting projects. They present an opportunity to have a dialogue rather than a debate. A dialogue entails working with others to resolve divergent opinions. The goal is to arrive at a resolution that all parties can embrace. A debate, on the other hand, is a win-lose scenario where people are more interested in winning personally than they are in being open to alternative solutions to a problem.\n▶ Support. Projects can be challenging from the perspectives of technical challenges, environmental influences, and interpersonal interactions. Supporting project team members through problem solving and removing impediments builds a supportive culture and leads to a trusting and collaborative environment. Support can also be demonstrated by providing encouragement, showing empathy, and engaging in active listening.\n▶ Courage. Recommending a new approach to a problem or a way of working can be intimidating. Likewise, it can be challenging to disagree with a subject matter expert or someone with greater authority. However, demonstrating the courage that it takes to make a suggestion, disagree, or try something new enables a culture of experimentation and communicates to others that it is safe to be courageous and try new approaches.\n▶ Celebrating success. Focusing on project goals, challenges, and issues often sidelines the fact that individual project team members and the project team as a whole are steadily progressing toward those goals. Because work takes priority, project team members may defer recognizing demonstrations of innovation, adaptation, service to others, and learning. However, recognizing such contributions in real time can keep the project team and individuals motivated.\n2.2.3 HIGH-PERFORMING PROJECT TEAMS\nOne goal of effective leadership is to create a high-performing project team. There are a number of factors that contribute to high-performing project teams. The list below is not comprehensive, but it identifies some of the factors associated with high-performing project teams.\n▶ Open communication. An environment that fosters open and safe communication allows for productive meetings, problem solving, brainstorming, and so forth. It is also the cornerstone for other factors, such as shared understanding, trust, and collaboration.\n▶ Shared understanding. The purpose for the project and the benefits it will provide are held in common.\n▶ Shared ownership. The more ownership of the outcomes that project team members feel, the better they are likely to perform.\n▶ Trust. A project team in which its members trust each other is willing to go the extra distance to deliver success. People are less likely to do the extra work it may take to succeed if they do not trust their project team members, project manager, or the organization.\n▶ Collaboration. Project teams that collaborate and work with each other rather than work in silos or compete tend to generate more diverse ideas and end up with better outcomes.\n▶ Adaptability. Project teams that are able to adapt the way they work to the environment and the situation are more effective.\n▶ Resilience. When issues or failures occur, high-performing project teams recover quickly.\n▶ Empowerment. Project team members who feel empowered to make decisions about the way they work perform better than those who are micromanaged.\n▶ Recognition. Project teams who are recognized for the work they put in and the performance they achieve are more likely to continue to perform well. Even the simple act of showing appreciation reinforces positive team behavior.\n2.2.4 LEADERSHIP SKILLS\nLeadership skills are useful for all project team members whether the project team is operating in an environment with a centralized authority or a shared leadership environment. The following sections describe some of the traits and activities associated with leadership.\n2.2.4.1 Establishing and Maintaining Vision\nEvery project has a purpose. Understanding that purpose is critical for people to commit their time and energy in the right direction toward achieving the project purpose. The project vision summarizes the project's purpose clearly and succinctly. It describes a realistic, attractive view of the future project outcomes.\nIn addition to briefly describing the desired future state, the vision is a powerful motivational tool. It is a way to create passion and meaning for a project's envisioned goal. A common vision helps keep people pulling in the same direction. When immersed in the details of everyday work, a clear understanding of the end goal can help guide local decisions toward the desired project outcome.\nA vision developed collaboratively between project team members and key stakeholders should answer these questions:\n▶ What is the project purpose?\n▶ What defines successful project work?\n▶ How will the future be better when the project outcomes are delivered?\n▶ How will the project team know that it is drifting from the vision?\nA good vision is clear, concise, and actionable. It does the following:\n▶ Summarizes the project with a powerful phrase or short description,\n▶ Describes the best achievable outcome,\n▶ Creates a common, cohesive picture in project team members’ minds, and\n▶ Inspires passion for the outcome.\n2.2.4.2 Critical Thinking\nThroughout the various project performance domains, there is a need to recognize bias, identify the root cause of problems, and consider challenging issues, such as ambiguity, complexity, and so forth. Critical thinking helps to accomplish these activities. Critical thinking includes disciplined, rational, logical, evidence-based thinking. It requires an open mind and the ability to analyze objectively. Critical thinking, especially when applied to discovery, can include conceptual imagination, insight, and intuition. It can also include reflective thinking and metacognition (thinking about thinking and being aware of one's awareness).\nProject team members apply critical thinking to:\n▶ Research and gather unbiased, well-balanced information;\n▶ Recognize, analyze, and resolve problems;\n▶ Identify bias, unstated assumptions, and values;\n▶ Discern the use of language and the influence on oneself and others;\n▶ Analyze data and evidence to evaluate arguments and perspectives;\n▶ Observe events to identify patterns and relationships;\n▶ Apply inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning appropriately; and\n▶ Identify and articulate false premises, false analogy, emotional appeals, and other faulty logic.\n2.2.4.3 Motivation\nMotivating project team members has two aspects: the first is understanding what motivates project team members to perform, and the second is working with project team members in such a way that they remain committed to the project and its outcomes.\nMotivation to perform can be intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from inside the individual or is associated with the work. It is associated with finding pleasure in the work itself rather than focusing on rewards. Extrinsic motivation is performing work because of an external reward such as a bonus. Much of the work done on projects is aligned with intrinsic motivation.\nExamples of intrinsic motivation factors include:\n▶ Achievement,\n▶ Challenge,\n▶ Belief in the work,\n▶ Making a difference,\n▶ Self-direction and autonomy,\n▶ Responsibility,\n▶ Personal growth,\n▶ Relatedness, and\n▶ Being part of a project team.\nPeople are not motivated by just one thing; however, most people have a dominant motivator. To effectively motivate project team members, it is helpful to know each member's dominant motivator. For example, a project team member who is motivated by challenge will respond well to stretch goals and problems to solve. A project team member who is motivated by relatedness will respond to being part of a dynamic working group. Project team members who thrive on autonomy will perform better if they can establish their own ways of working and even their own work hours and cadence. Therefore, tailoring motivation methods based on individual preferences helps to elicit the best individual and project team performance.\n2.2.4.4 Interpersonal Skills\nInterpersonal skills that are used frequently in projects include emotional intelligence, decision making, and conflict resolution among others.\n▶ Emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize our own emotions and those of others. This information is used to guide thinking and behavior. Recognition of personal feelings, empathy for the feelings of others, and the ability to act appropriately are the cornerstones for effective communication, collaboration, and leadership.\nSince projects are undertaken by people and for people, emotional intelligence—the ability to understand one's self and effectively sustain working relationships with others—is critical in project team environments.\nThere are multiple models for defining and explaining emotional intelligence. They converge on four key areas:\n▷ Self-awareness. Self-awareness is the ability to conduct a realistic self-assessment. It includes understanding our own emotions, goals, motivations, strengths, and weaknesses.\n▷ Self-management. Self-management, also known as self-regulation, is the ability to control and redirect disruptive feelings and impulses. It is the ability to think before acting, suspending snap judgments and impulsive decisions.\n▷ Social awareness. Social awareness is about empathy and understanding and considering other people's feelings. This includes the ability to read nonverbal cues and body language.\n▷ Social skill. Social skill is the culmination of the other dimensions of emotional intelligence. It is concerned with managing groups of people, such as project teams, building social networks, finding common ground with various stakeholders, and building rapport.\nSelf-awareness and self-management are required to remain calm and productive during difficult project circumstances. Social awareness and social skills allow for better bonds with project team members and project stakeholders. Emotional intelligence is a basis of all forms of leadership.\nFigure 2-5 shows the key points for each of the four aspects of emotional intelligence and how they relate. The aspects having to do with oneself are on the top, and the social aspects are on the bottom. Awareness is on the left side, and management and skill are on the right side.\nSome models for emotional intelligence include a fifth area for motivation. Motivation in this context is about understanding what drives and inspires people.\n▶ Decision making. Project managers and project teams make many decisions daily. Some decisions may be fairly inconsequential to the project outcome, such as where to go for a team lunch, and others will be very impactful, such as what development approach to use, which tool to use, or what vendor to select.\nDecisions can be made unilaterally. This has the advantage of being fast but is prone to error when compared to engaging the wisdom of a diverse set of people. Unilateral decision making can also demotivate people who are impacted by the decision since they may feel their views and concerns were not considered.\nGroup-based decision making has the benefit of tapping into the broad knowledge base of a group. Engaging people in the decision making process also increases buy-in to the outcome, even if the option selected may not have been everyone's first choice. Generally, inclusion increases commitment to the decision. The downside of group decision making is the time required and interruption to teamwork that can occur when taking people away from their work to be consulted in a decision.\nProject team decision making often follows a diverge/converge pattern. This means stakeholders are first engaged to generate a broad set of solution alternatives or approaches. This is often done individually to avoid the effect of senior or charismatic stakeholders unduly influencing other stakeholders. Then, after a broad spectrum of decision alternatives have been generated, the project team converges on a preferred solution.\nThe goal is to make decisions quickly while engaging the diverse knowledge of a group in an inclusive and respectful manner. Some decisions may be made in a different direction than some people prefer, but everyone has an opportunity to explain their position. In the end, the deciding authority, whether an individual or a group, makes a decision based on the presented analysis and with consideration for stakeholder expectations.\nCareful selection of which decisions should go for group discussion and voting limits the interruptions and task switching experienced by the project team. Many approaches such as Roman voting, wideband Delphi estimating, and fist of five voting use the diverge/converge pattern. They aim to engage individual input while voting at the same moment, which minimizes groupthink.\nFor those decisions that are beyond the authority of the project team to decide, the project team can investigate alternatives, consider impacts of each alternative, and escalate the decision to someone with the proper authority. This process aligns with the philosophy of “don't bring me problems, bring me solutions,” while remaining aligned with organizational governance regarding decision-making authority.\n▶ Conflict management. Conflict happens on all projects. Projects operate in dynamic environments and face many mutually exclusive constraints including budget, scope, schedule, and quality, which can lead to conflicts. It is not uncommon to want to avoid conflict, but not all conflict is negative. How conflict is handled can either lead to more conflict or to better decision making and stronger solutions.\nAddressing conflict before it escalates beyond useful debate leads to better outcomes. The following approaches can help:\n▷ Keep communications open and respectful. Because conflict can cause anxiety, it is important to keep a safe environment to explore the source of the conflict. Without a safe environment, people will stop communicating. Make sure words, tone of voice, and body language remain nonthreatening.\n▷ Focus on the issues, not the people. Conflict is based on people perceiving situations differently. It should not be personal. The focus is on resolving the situation, not casting blame.\n▷ Focus on the present and future, not the past. Stay focused on the current situation, not past situations. If something similar happened previously, bringing up the past will not resolve the current situation. In fact, it can serve to intensify the current situation even more.\n▷ Search for alternatives together. Damage incurred from conflict can be repaired by looking for resolutions and alternatives together. It can also create more constructive relationships. This moves the conflict into more of a problem-solving space where people can work together to generate creative alternatives.\nThere are several models for addressing and resolving conflict. Some of them are discussed in Section 4.\n2.2.5 TAILORING LEADERSHIP STYLES\nAs with all aspects of projects, leadership styles are also tailored to meet the needs of the project, the environment, and the stakeholders. Some of the variables that influence tailoring of leadership styles include:\n▶ Experience with the type of project. Organizations and project teams with experience on a specific type of project may be more self managing and require less leadership. When a project is new to an organization, the tendency is to provide more oversight and to use a more directive leadership style.\n▶ Maturity of the project team members. Project team members who are mature in the technical field may need less oversight and direction than project team members who are new to the organization, the team, or the technical specialty.\n▶ Organizational governance structures. Projects operate within a larger organizational system. There may be the expectation that the organizational leadership style of top management is recognized and reflected in the team's leadership. The organizational structure influences the degree to which authority and accountability are centralized or distributed.\n▶ Distributed project teams. A global project workforce is more common today than in the past. In spite of the best efforts to connect people virtually, it can be challenging to create the same level of collaboration and relatedness that is achieved when working face to face. To minimize the pitfalls of distributed project teams, technology can be used to increase and improve communication. Examples include:\n▷ Ensure there are collaboration sites for working together.\n▷ Have a project team site to keep all relevant project and project team information available.\n▷ Use audio and video capabilities for meetings.\n▷ Use technology to maintain ongoing contact, such as messaging and texting.\n▷ Build in time to get to know remote project team members.\n▷ Have at least one face-to-face meeting to establish relationships.\n2.2.6 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Team Performance Domain emphasizes the skills used by project managers and project team members throughout the project. These skills are woven into all other aspects of the project. Project team members are called on to demonstrate leadership qualities and skills throughout the project. Communicating the project vision and benefits to stakeholders while planning and throughout the life cycle is one example. Another example is employing critical thinking, problem solving, and decision making while engaging in project work. Accountability for outcomes is demonstrated throughout the Planning and Measurement Performance Domains.\n2.2.7 CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-3 identifies the outcomes from effective application of the Team Performance Domain on the left and ways of checking them on the right."

      "subsubtopic": "2.3 DEVELOPMENT APPROACH AND LIFE CYCLE PERFORMANCE DOMAIN",
      "content": "This performance domain entails establishing the development approach, delivery cadence, and project life cycle needed to optimize project outcomes.\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain:\nDeliverable. Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project.\nDevelopment Approach. A method used to create and evolve the product, service, or result during the project life cycle, such as a predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid method.\nCadence. A rhythm of activities conducted throughout the project.\nProject Phase. A collection of logically related project activities that culminates in the completion of one or more deliverables.\nProject Life Cycle. The series of phases that a project passes through from its start to its completion.\n2.3.1 DEVELOPMENT, CADENCE, AND LIFE CYCLE RELATIONSHIP\nThe type of project deliverable(s) determines how it can be developed. The type of deliverable(s) and the development approach influence the number and cadence for project deliveries. The deliverable approach and the desired delivery cadence determine the project life cycle and its phases.\n2.3.2 DELIVERY CADENCE\nDelivery cadence refers to the timing and frequency of project deliverables. Projects can have a single delivery, multiple deliveries, or periodic deliveries.\n▶ Single delivery. Projects that have a single delivery deliver at the end of the project. For example, a process reengineering project may not have any deliveries until near the end of the project when the new process is rolled out.\n▶ Multiple deliveries. Some projects have multiple deliveries. A project may have multiple components that are delivered at different times throughout the project. A project to develop a new drug may have multiple deliveries, such as preclinical submissions, Phase 1 trial results, Phase 2 trial results, Phase 3 trial results, registration, and then launch. In this example, the deliveries are sequential. Some projects have deliveries that are developed separately rather than sequentially, such as a project to update building security. Deliveries may include physical barriers to entry, new badges, new key code pads, and so forth. Each of these is a separate delivery, but they do not need to come in a specific order. All of the deliveries are concluded before the project is considered to be completed.\n▶ Periodic deliveries. Periodic deliveries are like multiple deliveries, but they are on a fixed delivery schedule, such as monthly or bimonthly. A new software application may have internal deliveries every two weeks, and then periodically release the deliveries into the market.\nAnother delivery option is called continuous delivery. Continuous delivery is the practice of delivering feature increments immediately to customers, often through the use of small batches of work and automation technology. Continuous delivery can be used for digital products. From the product management perspective, the emphasis is on delivering benefits and value throughout the product life cycle. Similar to a project, there are aspects that are development oriented. However, similar to a program, there can be many development cycles as well as maintenance activities. This type of undertaking works better with project teams that are stable and remain intact. Because the project teams are focused on one product, they can apply learning about the product, the stakeholders, and the market. This allows the team to respond to market trends and stay focused on value delivery. This practice is included in several approaches such as DevOps, #noprojects and Continuous Digital, for example.\n2.3.3 DEVELOPMENT APPROACHES\nA development approach is the means used to create and evolve the product, service, or result during the project life cycle. There are different development approaches, and different industries may use different terms to refer to development approaches. Three commonly used approaches are predictive, hybrid, and adaptive. As shown in Figure 2-7, these approaches are often viewed as a spectrum, from the predictive approach on one end of the spectrum, to the adaptive on the other end.\n▶ Predictive approach. A predictive approach is useful when the project and product requirements can be defined, collected, and analyzed at the start of the project. This may also be referred to as a waterfall approach. This approach may also be used when there is a significant investment involved and a high level of risk that may require frequent reviews, change control mechanisms, and replanning between development phases. The scope, schedule, cost, resource needs, and risks can be well defined in the early phases of the project life cycle, and they are relatively stable. This development approach allows the project team to reduce the level of uncertainty early in the project and do much of the planning up front. Predictive approaches may use proof-of-concept developments to explore options, but the majority of the project work follows the plans that were developed near the start of the project. Many times, projects that use this approach have templates from previous, similar projects.\nA project to develop a new community center might use a predictive approach for the construction of the grounds and facilities. The scope, schedule, cost, and resources would be determined up front, and changes would likely be minimal. The construction process would follow the plans and blueprints.\n▶ Hybrid approach. A hybrid development approach is a combination of adaptive and predictive approaches. This means that some elements from a predictive approach are used and some from an adaptive approach are used. This development approach is useful when there is uncertainty or risk around the requirements. Hybrid is also useful when deliverables can be modularized, or when there are deliverables that can be developed by different project teams. A hybrid approach is more adaptive than a predictive approach, but less so than a purely adaptive approach.\nHybrid approaches often use an iterative or incremental development approach. An iterative approach is useful for clarifying requirements and investigating various options. An iterative approach may produce sufficient capability to be considered acceptable prior to the final iteration. An incremental approach is used to produce a deliverable throughout a series of iterations. Each iteration adds functionality within a predetermined time frame (a timebox). The deliverable contains the capability to be considered as completed only after the final iteration.\nThe differences and interactions between iterative and incremental development are shown in Figure 2-8.\nAn example of a hybrid approach could be using an adaptive approach to develop a product that has significant uncertainty associated with the requirements. However, the deployment of the product can be done using a predictive approach. Another example is a project with two main deliverables where one deliverable is developed using an adaptive approach and the other using a predictive approach.\nAs part of the community center, a project to establish senior services could be developed and deployed iteratively. For example, the first iteration could be a Meals on Wheels program. This could be followed by a transportation service, then group outings and events, caregiver relief, adult day care, and so forth. Each service would be complete on its own and could be deployed when it was available. Each additional service would improve and increase the senior services for the community.\nA project to establish training for community action patrol volunteers could use an incremental approach. The training, comprised of basic training, logistics training, and patrol training, can be developed by different people. It can be developed at the same time in modules, or one module can be developed, feedback gathered, and then subsequent modules can be developed. However, the community action patrol training program will only be complete after all the modules are developed, integrated, and deployed.\n▶ Adaptive approach. Adaptive approaches are useful when requirements are subject to a high level of uncertainty and volatility and are likely to change throughout the project. A clear vision is established at the start of the project, and the initial known requirements are refined, detailed, changed, or replaced in accordance with user feedback, the environment, or unexpected events.\nAdaptive approaches use iterative and incremental approaches. However, on the far side of the adaptive methods, the iterations tend to get shorter and the product is more likely to evolve based on stakeholder feedback.\nWhile agility is a wide mindset that is broader than a development framework, agile approaches can be considered adaptive. Some agile approaches entail iterations that are 1 to 2 weeks in duration with a demonstration of the accomplishments at the end of each iteration. The project team is very engaged with the planning for each iteration. The project team will determine the scope they can achieve based on a prioritized backlog, estimate the work involved, and work collaboratively throughout the iteration to develop the scope.\nThe community center will need a website so community members can access information from their home computer, phone, or tablet. The high-level requirements, design, and page layouts can be defined up front. An initial set of information can be deployed on the website. User feedback, new services, and internal stakeholder needs would provide content for a backlog. The backlog information would be prioritized, and the web team would develop and deploy new content. As new requirements and new scope emerge, the estimates for the work would be developed, the work would be done, and once tested, it would be demonstrated for stakeholders. If approved, the work would be deployed to the website.\n2.3.4 CONSIDERATIONS FOR SELECTING A DEVELOPMENT APPROACH\nThere are several factors that influence the selection of a development approach. They can be divided into categories of the product, service, or result; the project; and the organization. The following subsections describe the variables associated with each category.\n2.3.4.1 Product, Service, or Result\nThere are many variables associated with the nature of the product, service, or result that influence the development approach. The following list outlines some of the variables to consider when selecting the development approach.\n▶ Degree of innovation. Deliverables where the scope and requirements are well understood, that the project team has worked with before, and that allow for planning up front are well suited to a predictive approach. Deliverables that have a high degree of innovation or where the project team does not have experience are better suited to a more adaptive approach.\n▶ Requirements certainty. When the requirements are well known and easy to define, a predictive approach fits well. When requirements are uncertain, volatile, or complex and are expected to evolve throughout the project, a more adaptive approach may be a better fit.\n▶ Scope stability. If the scope of the deliverable is stable and not likely to change, a predictive approach is useful. If the scope is expected to have many changes, an approach that is closer to the adaptive side of the spectrum can be useful.\n▶ Ease of change. Related to the requirements certainty and the scope stability, if the nature of the deliverable makes it difficult to manage and incorporate changes, then a predictive approach is best. Deliverables that can adapt easily to change can use an approach that is more adaptive.\n▶ Delivery options. As described in Section 2.3.2 on Delivery Cadence, the nature of the deliverable and whether it can be delivered in components influences the development approach. Products, services, or results that can be developed and/or delivered in pieces are aligned with incremental, iterative, or adaptive approaches. Some large projects may be planned using a predictive approach, but there may be some pieces that can be developed and delivered incrementally.\n▶ Risk. Products that are inherently high risk require analysis before choosing the development approach. Some high-risk products may require significant up-front planning and rigorous processes to reduce threats. Other products can reduce risk by building them modularly and adapting the design and development based on learning to take advantage of emerging opportunities or reduce the exposure to threats.\n▶ Safety requirements. Products that have rigorous safety requirements often use a predictive approach as there is a need for significant up front planning to ensure that all the safety requirements are identified, planned for, created, integrated, and tested.\n▶ Regulations. Environments that have significant regulatory oversight may need to use a predictive approach due to the required process, documentation, and demonstration needs.\n2.3.4.2 Project\nProject variables that influence the development approach are centered around stakeholders, schedule constraints, and funding availability.\n▶ Stakeholders. Projects that use adaptive methods require significant stakeholder involvement throughout the process. Certain stakeholders, such as the product owner, play a substantial role in establishing and prioritizing work.\n▶ Schedule constraints. If there is a need to deliver something early, even if it is not a finished product, an iterative or adaptive approach is beneficial.\n▶ Funding availability. Projects that work in an environment of funding uncertainty can benefit from an adaptive or iterative approach. A minimum viable product can be released with less investment than an elaborate product. This allows for market testing or market capture with minimum investment. Further investments can be made based on the market response to the product or service.\n2.3.4.3 Organization\nOrganizational variables such as the structure, culture, capability, project team size, and location influence the development approach.\n▶ Organizational structure. An organizational structure that has many levels, a rigid reporting structure, and substantial bureaucracy frequently uses a predictive approach. Projects that use adaptive methods tend to have a flat structure and may operate with self organizing project teams.\n▶ Culture. A predictive approach fits better in an organization with a culture of managing and directing, where the work is planned out and progress is measured against baselines. Adaptive approaches fit better within an organization that emphasizes project team self management.\n▶ Organizational capability. Transitioning from predictive development approaches to adaptive approaches and then to using agile methods is more than just stating that the organization will now be agile. It entails shifting the mindset starting at the executive level throughout the organization. Organizational policies, ways of working, reporting structure, and attitude should all be aligned in order to employ adaptive methods successfully.\n▶ Project team size and location. Adaptive approaches, especially agile methods, often work better with project teams of 7 ± 2. Adaptive approaches also favor project teams that are located in the same physical space. Large project teams and project teams that are mostly virtual may do better by using an approach that is closer to the predictive side of the spectrum. However, there are approaches that seek to scale up the adaptive approaches to work with large and dispersed project teams.\n2.3.5 LIFE CYCLE AND PHASE DEFINITIONS\nThe type and number of project phases in a project life cycle depend upon many variables, chief among them the delivery cadence and the development approach, as described previously. Examples of phases in a life cycle include:\n▶ Feasibility. This phase determines if the business case is valid and if the organization has the capability to deliver the intended outcome.\n▶ Design. Planning and analysis lead to the design of the project deliverable that will be developed.\n▶ Build. Construction of the deliverable with integrated quality assurance activities is conducted.\n▶ Test. Final quality review and inspection of deliverables are carried out before transition, go-live, or acceptance by the customer.\n▶ Deploy. Project deliverables are put into use and transitional activities required for sustainment, benefits realization, and organizational change management are completed.\n▶ Close. The project is closed, project knowledge and artifacts are archived, project team members are released, and contracts are closed.\nProject phases often have a phase gate review (also known as stage gate) to check that the desired outcomes or exit criteria for the phase have been achieved before proceeding to the next phase. Exit criteria may tie to acceptance criteria for deliverables, contractual obligations, meeting specific performance targets, or other tangible measures.\nFigure 2-9 shows a life cycle where one phase finishes before the next one begins. This type of life cycle would fit well with a predictive development approach since each phase is only performed once, and each phase focuses on a particular type of work. However, there are situations, such as adding scope, a change in requirements, or a change in the market that cause phases to be repeated.\nFigure 2-10 shows a life cycle with an incremental development approach. There are three iterations of plan, design, and build shown in this example. Each subsequent build would add functionality to the initial build.\nFigure 2-11 shows a life cycle using an adaptive development approach. At the end of each iteration (sometimes known as a sprint), the customer reviews a functional deliverable. At the review, the key stakeholders provide feedback, and the project team updates the project backlog of features and functions to prioritize for the next iteration.\nThis approach can be modified for use in continuous delivery situations, as described in Section 2.3.2 on Delivery Cadence.\nSeveral adaptive methodologies, including agile, use flow-based scheduling, which does not use a life cycle or phases. One goal is to optimize the flow of deliveries based on resource capacity, materials, and other inputs. Another goal is to minimize time and resource waste and optimize the efficiency of processes and the throughput of deliverables. Projects that use these practices and methods usually adopt them from the Kanban scheduling system used in lean and just-in-time scheduling approaches.\n2.3.6 ALIGNING OF DELIVERY CADENCE, DEVELOPMENT APPROACH, AND LIFE CYCLE\nThe community center examples described in Section 2.3.3 will be revisited to demonstrate how the delivery cadence, development approach, and life cycle fit together. In this example, there are four products and services: the building, the community action patrol (CAP) training, the senior services, and the website. Table 2-4 describes the delivery cadence and the development approach.\nBased on this information, a potential life cycle might be:\n▶ Start Up. Entry criteria for this phase are that the business case has been approved and the project charter has been authorized. In this phase, the high-level roadmap is developed, initial funding requirements are established, project team and resource requirements are defined, a milestone schedule is created, and planning for a procurement strategy is defined. These deliverables should be complete prior to exiting the start-up phase. Exit criteria will be reviewed at an origination phase gate review.\n▶ Plan. In this phase, the high-level information for the building is decomposed into detailed plans. A detailed design document for the CAP training is completed. An analysis of the senior services offering is completed along with a gap analysis. The initial wireframe for the website is created. These deliverables should be complete prior to exiting the planning phase. Exit criteria will be reviewed at a planning phase gate review.\n▶ Development. This phase will overlap with the test and deploy phases since the deliverables have different delivery cadences and different approaches. The website will have early deliveries to inform the public of the progress for the community center. Some senior services and the CAP training may begin prior to the opening of the community center. Each deliverable may have a separate review prior to entering the testing phase.\n▶ Test. This phase will overlap with the development and deploy phases. The type of test will depend on the deliverable. This phase includes inspections for the building, a beta delivery of the CAP courses, small-scale trials for the senior services, and operating in a test environment for each release for the website. Each deliverable will go through the applicable testing prior to moving to the deploy phase.\n▶ Deploy. This phase will overlap with the development and test phases. The first deployment of the website may be somewhat early in the project. Activities in this phase will iterate as more deliverables become available. The final deployment for the project will be the opening of the community center. Ongoing updates to the website and the senior services will be part of operations once the community center is open.\n▶ Close. This phase takes place periodically as deliverables are completed. When the initial website has been deployed, project personnel (including contractors) will be released and retrospectives or lessons learned for each deliverable will be completed. When the entire project is done, information from the various phase gate reviews and an overall evaluation of project performance compared to baselines will be conducted. Prior to final closeout, the project charter and the business case will be reviewed to determine if the deliverables achieved the intended benefits and value.\nFigure 2-12 shows a possible life cycle for the community center project. The start-up and planning phases are sequential. The development, test, and deploy phases overlap because the different deliverables will be developed, tested, and deployed at different times, and some deliverables will have multiple deliveries. The development phase is shown in more detail to demonstrate different timing and delivery cadence. The test phase cadence would follow the development phase cadence. The deliveries are shown in the deploy phase.\nWhat's in a Name? Not all project practitioners differentiate between the development approach and the life cycle. Some practitioners will say a project follows an agile life cycle when they are actually talking about the development approach. Some practitioners refer to predictive approaches as waterfall. Adaptive development approaches may also be known as evolutionary approaches.\nBecause project management is evolving, the language used continues to evolve. The best way to understand what a person is referring to is to determine how they are developing deliverables and ask them the names of the phases in the life cycle. This can help frame the project and understand how people are using terms.\n2.3.7 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain interacts with the Stakeholder, Planning, Uncertainty, Delivery, Project Work, and Team Performance Domains. The life cycle selected impacts the way in which planning is undertaken. Predictive life cycles undertake the bulk of the planning up front and then continue to replan by using rolling wave planning and progressive elaboration. Plans are also updated as threats and opportunities materialize.\nThe development approach and delivery cadence is one way to reduce uncertainty on projects. A deliverable that has a lot of risk associated with meeting regulatory requirements may choose a predictive approach to build in extra testing, documentation, and robust processes and procedures. A deliverable that has a lot of risk associated with stakeholder acceptance may choose an iterative approach and release a minimum viable product to the market to get feedback before developing additional features and functions.\nThe Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain has significant overlap with the Delivery Performance Domain when considering delivery cadence and development approach. The delivery cadence is one of the main drivers of delivering value in alignment with the business case and the benefits realization plans. Eliciting the product requirements and meeting the quality requirements as described in the Delivery Performance Domain have a significant influence on the development approach.\nThe Team Performance Domain and the Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain interact when it comes to project team capabilities and project team leadership skills. The project team's way of working and the project manager's style vary significantly depending on the development approach. A predictive approach usually entails more emphasis on up-front planning, measurement, and control. On the other end of the spectrum, an adaptive approach, especially when using agile methods, requires more of a servant leadership style and may have self-managing project teams.\n2.3.8 MEASURING OUTCOMES\nTable 2-5 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right."

      "subtopic": "2 Project Performance Domains",
      "subsubtopic": "2.4 PLANNING PERFORMANCE DOMAIN",
      "content": "Planning organizes, elaborates, and coordinates project work throughout the project.\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Planning Performance Domain:\nEstimate. A quantitative assessment of the likely amount or outcome of a variable, such as project costs, resources, effort, or durations.\nAccuracy. Within the quality management system, accuracy is an assessment of correctness.\nPrecision. Within the quality management system, precision is an assessment of exactness.\nCrashing. A method used to shorten the schedule duration for the least incremental cost by adding resources.\nFast Tracking. A schedule compression method in which activities or phases normally done in sequence are performed in parallel for at least a portion of their duration.\nBudget. The approved estimate for the project or any work breakdown structure (WBS) component or any schedule activity.\n2.4.1 PLANNING OVERVIEW\nThe purpose of planning is to proactively develop an approach to create the project deliverables. The project deliverables drive the outcomes the project was undertaken to achieve. High-level planning may begin prior to project authorization. The project team progressively elaborates initial project documents, such as a vision statement, project charter, business case, or similar documents to identify or define a coordinated path to achieve the desired outcomes.\nIt is becoming more common for initial planning to consider social and environmental impacts in addition to the financial impacts (sometimes referred to as the triple bottom line). This may take the form of a product life cycle assessment which evaluates the potential environmental impacts of a product, process, or system. The product life cycle assessment informs the design of products and processes. It considers the impacts of materials and processes with regards to sustainability, toxicity, and the environment.\nThe amount of time spent planning, both up front and throughout the project, should be determined by the circumstances. It is inefficient to spend more time planning than is needed. Therefore, the information gained from planning should be sufficient to move forward in an appropriate manner but not more detailed than necessary. Project teams use planning artifacts to confirm stakeholder expectations and provide stakeholders with the information they need to make decisions, take action, and maintain alignment between the project and stakeholders.\n2.4.2 PLANNING VARIABLES\nBecause each project is unique, the amount, timing, and frequency of planning varies. Variables that influence how project planning is conducted include, but are not limited to:\n▶ Development approach. The development approach can influence how, how much, and when planning is conducted. Examples include:\n▷ A specific phase for planning or organizing early in the life cycle. In these situations, much of the planning is performed up front. The initial plans are progressively elaborated with more detail throughout the project, but there is little change to the original scope.\n▷ An approach with high-level planning up front, followed by a design phase where prototyping is used. After the project team and stakeholders agree to the design, the project team completes more detailed planning.\n▷ Adaptive approaches where the project team conducts iterations. Some planning occurs up front to establish release plans and further planning occurs at the beginning of each iteration.\n▶ Project deliverables. Often the project deliverables necessitate planning in a specific way. Construction projects require significant up-front planning to account for design, approvals, materials purchasing, logistics, and delivery. Product development or high technology projects may use continuous and adaptive planning to allow for evolution and changes based on stakeholder feedback and technological advances.\n▶ Organizational requirements. Organizational governance, policies, procedures, processes, and culture may require project managers to produce specific planning artifacts.\n▶ Market conditions. Product development projects can take place in a highly competitive environment. In these situations, project teams can undertake a minimum amount of up-front planning as the emphasis is on speed to market. The cost of delay that extensive planning entails exceeds the risk of potential rework.\n▶ Legal or regulatory restrictions. Regulatory agencies or statutes may require specific planning documents before granting an authorization to proceed or to secure approval to release the project deliverable into the market.\n2.4.2.1 Delivery\nPlanning begins with understanding the business case, stakeholder requirements, and the project and product scope. Product scope is the features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result. Project scope is the work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions.\nPredictive planning approaches start with the high-level project deliverables up front and decompose them into more detail. This approach can employ a scope statement and/or a work breakdown structure (WBS) to decompose the scope into lower levels of detail.\nProjects that use iterative or incremental approaches can have high-level themes or epics that are decomposed into features, which are then further decomposed into user stories and other backlog items. Work that is unique, significant, risky, or novel can be prioritized to reduce the uncertainty associated with project scope at the start of the project before significant investment has taken place. Project teams plan routine work based on the concept of last responsible moment. This approach defers a decision to allow the project team to consider multiple options until the cost of further delay would exceed the benefit. It reduces waste by not expending time in developing plans for work that may change or may not be needed.\n2.4.2.2 Estimating\nPlanning entails developing estimates for work effort, duration, costs, people, and physical resources. Estimates are a quantitative assessment of the likely amount or outcome of a variable, such as project costs, resources, effort, or duration. As the project evolves, the estimates can change based on current information and circumstances. The project's phase in the life cycle impacts four aspects associated with estimating:\n▶ Range. Estimates tend to have a broad range at the start of the project when there is not much information about the project and product scope, stakeholders, requirements, risks, and other information. Figure 2-14 shows a range of -25 to +75% at the start of exploring a project opportunity. Projects that are well along in their life cycle may have an estimating range of -5 to +10%.\n▶ Accuracy. Accuracy refers to the correctness of an estimate. Accuracy is linked to range in that the lower the accuracy, the larger the potential range of values. An estimate at the start of the project will have less accuracy than one that is developed halfway through the project.\n▶ Precision. Precision is different from accuracy (see Figure 2-15). Precision refers to the degree of exactness associated with the estimate. For example, an estimate of 2 days is more precise than “sometime this week.” The precision of estimates should be compatible with the desired accuracy.\n▶ Confidence. Confidence increases with experience. Experience working on a previous, similar project can help with the level of confidence required. For new and evolving technology components, the confidence in estimates is expected to be low.\nThere are different ways of presenting and/or adjusting estimates:\n▶ Deterministic and probabilistic estimating. Deterministic estimates, also known as point estimates, present a single number or amount, such as 36 months.\nProbabilistic estimates include a range of estimates along with the associated probabilities within the range. They can be developed manually by (a) developing a weighted average based on multiple likely outcomes, or (b) running a simulation to develop a probability analysis of a particular outcome, usually in terms of cost or schedule.\nA probabilistic estimate derived from a computer simulation has three associated factors:\n1. A point estimate with a range such as 36 months +3 months/-1 month.\n2. A statement of confidence such as a 95% confidence level.\n3. A probability distribution describing the dispersion of the data within and around the given range.\nTogether these three items form a complete metric describing a probabilistic estimate.\n▶ Absolute and relative estimating. Absolute estimates are specific information and use actual numbers. An absolute estimate for effort might be shown as 120 hours of work. One person working full time could accomplish the work in 15 workdays, assuming 8 hours of productivity per workday.\nWhile absolute estimates are specific, relative estimates are shown in comparison to other estimates. Relative estimates only have meaning within a given context.\nOne form of relative estimating is planning poker. In planning poker, the project team performing the work comes to a consensus on the effort that is necessary to deliver value. Using story points to estimate work could result in 64 story points being assigned for that work. New work is estimated using the amount of estimated work compared to points assigned to previous work. Therefore, new work effort is compared to previously known work effort.\n▶ Flow-based estimating. Flow-based estimates are developed by determining the cycle time and throughput. Cycle time is the total elapsed time it takes one unit to get through a process. Throughput is the number of items that can complete a process in a given amount of time. These two numbers can provide an estimate to complete a specified quantity of work.\n▶ Adjusting estimates for uncertainty. Estimates are inherently uncertain. Uncertainty by definition is associated with risk. Key deliverable dates or budget estimates may be adjusted, or contingency time or funds may be added, based on the outcomes of a simulation conducted to establish the range of uncertainty for these parameters.\n2.4.2.3 Schedules\nA schedule is a model for executing the project's activities, including durations, dependencies, and other planning information. Schedule planning can use predictive or adaptive approaches.\nPredictive approaches follow a stepwise process as follows:\n▶ Step 1. Decompose the project scope into specific activities.\n▶ Step 2. Sequence related activities.\n▶ Step 3. Estimate the effort, duration, people, and physical resources required to complete the activities.\n▶ Step 4. Allocate people and resources to the activities based on availability.\n▶ Step 5. Adjust the sequence, estimates, and resources until an agreed upon schedule is achieved.\nIf the schedule model does not meet the initial desired end date, schedule compression methods are applied. Crashing is a schedule compression method that seeks to shorten the duration for the least incremental cost. Crashing can include adding people to activities, working overtime, or paying to expedite deliveries.\nFast tracking is a schedule compression method in which activities or tasks that are normally done in sequence are performed in parallel, at least for a portion of their duration. Fast tracking often entails applying leads and lags along a network path. A lead is where the work of a successor activity is accelerated, such as starting a successor activity before the predecessor has finished. In Figure 2-16, there is a lead between the finish of Task 2 and the start of Task 4.\nA lag is a delay of a successor activity. An example of using a lag would be changing the type of relationship between activities, and then applying a lag. For example, rather than waiting for an activity to finish before the next one starts (a finish-to-start relationship), change the relationship to have the end of the successor activity finish a determined amount of time after the end of the predecessor (a finish-to-finish relationship). The network logic would show a lag between the finish of the predecessor and the finish of the successor activities. There is an example of a finish-to-finish relationship with a lag in Figure 2-16 between Task 8 and Task 7. A lag can also be applied between the start of one activity and the start of another activity (a start-to-start relationship).\nWhen compressing the schedule, it is important to determine the nature of the dependencies between activities. Some activities cannot be fast tracked due to the nature of the work—others can. The four types of dependencies are:\n▶ Mandatory dependency. A relationship that is contractually required or inherent in the nature of the work. This type of dependency usually cannot be modified.\n▶ Discretionary dependency. A relationship that is based on best practices or project preferences. This type of dependency may be modifiable.\n▶ External dependency. A relationship between project activities and non-project activities. This type of dependency usually cannot be modified.\n▶ Internal dependency. A relationship between one or more project activities. This type of dependency may be modifiable.\nAdaptive schedule planning uses incremental planning. One such scheduling approach is based on iterations and releases (see Figure 2-17). A high-level release plan is developed that indicates the basic features and functionality to be included in each release. Within each release, there will be two or more iterations. Each iteration adds business and/or stakeholder value. Value may include features, risk reduction, experimentation, or other ways of delivering or protecting value. The planning for the work in future releases is kept at a high level so the project team does not engage in planning that could change based on feedback from earlier releases.\nAdaptive approaches often use timeboxes. The work in each timebox is based on a prioritized backlog. The project team determines the amount of work they can do in each timebox, estimates the work, and self-manages to accomplish the work. At the end of the timebox, the project team demonstrates the work completed. At that point, the backlog and estimates of work available to be done may be updated or reprioritized for the next timebox.\nDetermining the schedule involves using the information in the estimating section to determine overall duration and effort estimates. Regardless of the scheduling approach used, the relationship between effort and duration needs to be addressed. Some activities are effort driven, which means that the duration can be reduced by adding people. This approach can work up to a point, after which adding people might actually extend duration. Framing a building is effort driven. If more people are added, the duration can be reduced. Some activities are fixed duration, such as running a test or conducting employee training.\nThe nature of the work determines if and how much the duration can be reduced by adding people before increasing the time due to coordination, communication, conflict, and potential rework. There is no fixed formula to determine the reduction in duration due to the addition of people.\n2.4.2.4 Budget\nThe project budget evolves from the agreed estimates for the project. The information in Section 2.4.2.2 on Estimating is applied to project costs to develop cost estimates. Cost estimates are then aggregated to develop the cost baseline. The cost baseline is often allocated across the project schedule to reflect when the costs will be incurred. This practice allows project managers to balance the funds approved in a specific budget period with the scheduled work. If there are funding limitations for a budget period, the work may need to be rescheduled to meet those limitations.\nThe project budget should include contingency reserve funds to allow for uncertainty. Contingency reserves are set aside to implement a risk response or to respond to risk events should they occur.\nManagement reserves are set aside for unexpected activities related to in-scope work. Depending on the organization's policies and organizational structure, management reserves may be managed by the project, the sponsor, product owner, or the PMO at the program and portfolio level. Figure 2-18 shows the budget build up.\n2.4.3 PROJECT TEAM COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE\nPlanning for project team2 composition begins with identifying the skill sets required to accomplish the project work. This entails evaluating not only the skills, but also the level of proficiency and years of experience in similar projects.\nThere are different cost structures associated with using internal project team members versus securing them from outside the organization. The benefit that outside skills bring to the project are weighed against the costs that will be incurred.\nWhen planning for the project team, the project manager considers the ability and necessity for the project team to work in the same location. Small project teams that can work in the same room are able to take advantage of osmotic communication and can solve problems as they arise. Some project teams are physically dispersed. Project team members may be in different cities, time zones, or countries. On projects where project team members work virtually, more time is spent connecting people through technology.\n2.4.4 COMMUNICATION\nCommunication planning overlaps with stakeholder identification, analysis, prioritization, and engagement as described in the Stakeholder Performance Domain (Section 2.1). Communication is the most important factor in engaging with stakeholders effectively. Planning communication for the project entails considering the following:\n▶ Who needs information?\n▶ What information does each stakeholder need?\n▶ Why should information be shared with stakeholders?\n▶ What is the best way to provide information?\n▶ When and how often is information needed?\n▶ Who has the information needed?\nThere may be different categories of information, such as internal and external, sensitive and public, or general and detailed. Analyzing the stakeholders, information needs, and categories of information provides the foundation for establishing the communications processes and plans for the project.\n2.4.5 PHYSICAL RESOURCES\nPhysical resources apply to any resource that is not a person. It can include materials, equipment, software, testing environments, licenses, and so forth. Planning for physical resources entails estimating, as described in Section 2.4.2.2, as well as supply chain, logistics, and management. Projects with significant physical resources, such as engineering and construction projects, will need to plan for procurement activities to acquire the resources. This may be as simple as utilizing a basic ordering agreement or as complicated as managing, coordinating, and integrating several large procurement activities.\nPlanning for physical resources includes taking into account lead time for delivery, movement, storage, and disposition of materials, as well as a means to track material inventory from arrival on site to delivery of an integrated product. Project teams whose projects require significant physical materials think and plan strategically about the timing from order, to delivery, to usage. This can include evaluation of bulk ordering versus cost of storage, global logistics, sustainability, and integrating management of physical assets with the rest of the project.\n2.4.6 PROCUREMENT\nProcurements can happen at any time during a project. However, up front planning helps to set expectations that ensure the procurement process is performed smoothly. Once the high-level scope is known, project teams conduct a make-or-buy analysis. This includes identifying those deliverables and services that will be developed in-house, and those that will be purchased from external sources. This information impacts the project team and the schedule. Contracting professionals need advance information on the type of goods needed, when they will be needed, and any technical specifications required for the procured goods or services.\n2.4.7 CHANGES\nThere will be changes throughout the project. Some changes are a result of a risk event occurring or a project environment change, some are based on developing a deeper understanding of requirements, and others are due to customer requests or other reasons. Therefore, project teams should prepare a process for adapting plans throughout the project. This may take the form of a change control process, reprioritizing the backlog, or rebaselining the project. Projects that have a contractual element may need to follow a defined process for contract changes.\n2.4.8 METRICS\nThere is a natural linkage between planning, delivering, and measuring work. That linkage is metrics. Establishing metrics includes setting the thresholds that indicate whether work performance is as expected, trending positively or negatively away from expected performance, or unacceptable. Deciding what to measure and how often is best informed by the phrase “only measure what matters.”\nMetrics associated with the product are specific to the deliverables being developed. Metrics associated with schedule and budget performance are often driven by organizational standards and are related to a baseline or an approved version of the schedule or budget against which actual results are compared.\nAs part of planning, the metrics, baselines, and thresholds for performance are established, as well as any test and evaluation processes and procedures that will be used to measure performance to the specification of the project deliverable. The metrics, baselines, and tests are used as the basis to evaluate variance of actual performance as part of the Measurement Performance Domain.\n2.4.9 ALIGNMENT\nPlanning activities and artifacts need to remain integrated throughout the project. This means that planning for the performance in terms of scope and quality requirements aligns with delivery commitments, allocated funds, type and availability of resources, the uncertainty inherent in the project, and stakeholder needs. Project teams can require additional planning artifacts depending on the type of project. For example, logistics plans will need to integrate with material and delivery needs, testing plans will need to align with quality and delivery needs, and so forth.\nWork on one project often occurs in parallel with other projects in a program or a release. The timing of the work of a single project should align with the needs of the work on related projects and the operations work of the organization.\nLarge projects may combine the planning artifacts into an integrated project management plan. For smaller projects, a detailed project management plan will be inefficient. Regardless of the timing, frequency, and degree of planning, the various aspects of the project need to remain aligned and integrated.\n2.4.10 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nPlanning occurs throughout the project and integrates with each performance domain. At the start of the project, the expected outcomes are identified and high-level plans to achieve them are developed. Depending on the selected development approach and life cycle, intensive planning may be conducted up front, and then plans may be adjusted to reflect the actual environment. Other life cycles encourage just enough planning at various points throughout the project with the expectation that plans will evolve.\nThroughout the project, planning guides the project work, delivery of outcomes, and business value. Project teams and stakeholders establish measures of progress and success, and performance is compared to plans. Uncertainty and planning interact as project teams plan for how to address uncertainty and risks. Plans may need to be revised or new plans developed to account for events or conditions that emerge. The project team members, environment, and project details influence plans for working effectively with the project team and engaging proactively with stakeholders.\n2.4.11 CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-6 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right."

      "content": "Project work is associated with establishing the processes and performing the work to enable the project team to deliver the expected deliverables and outcomes.\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Project Work Performance Domain:\nBid Documents. All documents used to solicit information, quotations, or proposals from prospective sellers.\nBidder Conference. The meetings with prospective sellers prior to the preparation of a bid or proposal to ensure all prospective vendors have a clear and common understanding of the procurement. Also known as contractor conferences, vendor conferences, or pre-bid conferences.\nExplicit Knowledge. Knowledge that can be codified using symbols such as words, numbers, and pictures.\nTacit Knowledge. Personal knowledge that can be difficult to articulate and share such as beliefs, experience, and insights.\nProject work keeps the project team focused and project activities running smoothly. This includes but is not limited to:\n▶ Managing the flow of existing work, new work, and changes to work;\n▶ Keeping the project team focused;\n▶ Establishing efficient project systems and processes;\n▶ Communicating with stakeholders;\n▶ Managing material, equipment, supplies, and logistics;\n▶ Working with contracting professionals and vendors to plan and manage procurements and contracts;\n▶ Monitoring changes that can affect the project; and\n▶ Enabling project learning and knowledge transfer.\n2.5.1 PROJECT PROCESSES\nThe project manager and the project team establish and periodically review the processes the project team is using to conduct the work. This can take the form of reviewing task boards to determine if there are bottlenecks in the process, if work is flowing at the expected rate, and if there are any impediments that are blocking progress.\nProcess tailoring can be used to optimize the process for the needs of the project. In general, large projects have more process compared to small projects, and critical projects have more process than less significant projects. Tailoring takes into consideration the demands of the environment. Ways of optimizing the processes for the environment include:\n▶ Lean production methods. Lean production uses techniques such as value stream mapping to measure the ratio of value-adding activities and non-value-adding activities. The metrics calculated form a basis and measurement system for identifying and removing waste from production systems.\n▶ Retrospectives or lessons learned. These meetings provide an opportunity for the project team to review the way in which it works and to suggest changes to improve process and efficiency.\n▶ Where is the next best funding spent? Asking this question can help project teams determine if they should continue with the current task or move onto the next activity to optimize value delivery.\nReviewing processes can entail determining if processes are efficient, or if there is waste in the process that can be eliminated. Time spent tracking conformance to process is time the project team cannot spend on delivering the outcomes for which the project was commissioned. Therefore, project teams utilize just enough time reviewing process conformance to maximize the benefits delivered from the review while still satisfying the governance needs of process.\nExample of non-value-added work. A PMO wants to track the type of work project team members are doing. They ask the project team to record the type of work they are doing in specific categories on their time sheets. The time taken to categorize and record their time can be viewed as non-value-added work.\nIn addition to being efficient, processes should be effective. This means they need to comply with quality requirements, regulations, standards, and organizational policies in addition to producing the desired outcome. Process evaluation can include process audits and quality assurance activities to ensure processes are being followed and are accomplishing the intended outcomes.\n2.5.2 BALANCING COMPETING CONSTRAINTS\nSuccessfully leading a project includes understanding the constraints associated with the work. Constraints can take the form of fixed delivery dates, compliance to regulatory codes, a predetermined budget, quality policies, considerations of the triple bottom line, and so forth. The constraints may shift and change throughout the project. A new stakeholder requirement may entail expanding the schedule and budget. A reduction in budget may entail relaxing a quality requirement or reducing scope.\nBalancing these shifting constraints, while maintaining stakeholder satisfaction, is an ongoing project activity. At times, it may include meeting with the customer, sponsor, or product owner to present alternatives and implications. Other times, the decisions and potential variances may be within the project team's authority to make trade-offs to deliver the end result. Either way, this balancing activity is ongoing throughout the project.\n2.5.3 MAINTAINING PROJECT TEAM FOCUS\nProject managers have a responsibility for assessing and balancing the project team focus and attention. This involves evaluating short- and long-term projections of progress toward delivery goals.\nLeading the project team includes balancing the workload and assessing if project team members are satisfied with their work so they remain motivated. To maximize business and stakeholder value delivered throughout the project, project team attention needs to be kept in a healthy balance. Leading with a goal of maximizing overall delivered value involves focusing on production (delivering value) and protecting the project team's production capability (project team health and satisfaction). The goal is to keep the project team focused on delivering value and maintain awareness of when potential issues, delays, and cost overruns enter the project.\n2.5.4 PROJECT COMMUNICATIONS AND ENGAGEMENT\nMuch of the project work is associated with communication and engagement, especially work associated with maintaining project team member and other stakeholder engagement. As described in the Stakeholder Performance Domain, communication entails formal and informal communication, in addition to verbal and written communication. Information can be collected in meetings, conversations, and by pulling information from electronic repositories. Once collected, it is distributed as indicated in the project management communications plan.\nOn a day-to-day basis, there are ad hoc requests for information, presentations, reports, and other forms of communication. An abundance of ad hoc communication requests may indicate that the communication planning was not sufficient to meet stakeholder needs. In this situation, further stakeholder engagement may be necessary to ensure stakeholder information requirements are met.\n2.5.5 MANAGING PHYSICAL RESOURCES\nSome projects require materials and supplies from third parties. Planning, ordering, transporting, storing, tracking, and controlling these physical resources can take a large amount of time and effort.\nLarge amounts of physical resources require an integrated logistics system. This is usually documented in company policies that are then implemented in projects. A logistics plan describes how the company policy will be implemented on the project. Supporting documentation includes estimates for the type of material, basis of estimates, expected usage over time, specifications for grade, and the time and location for deliveries.\nThe objectives from a physical resource perspective are to:\n▶ Reduce or eliminate the material handling and storage on site,\n▶ Eliminate wait times for materials,\n▶ Minimize scrap and waste, and\n▶ Facilitate a safe work environment.\nAll of this work is integrated with the master project schedule to provide clear expectations and communications for all parties involved.\n2.5.6 WORKING WITH PROCUREMENTS\nMany projects involve some form of contracting or procurement. Procurement can cover everything from material, capital equipment, and supplies to solutions, labor, and services. In most organizations, project managers do not have contracting authority. Rather, they work with contracting officers or other people with expertise in contracts, laws, and regulations. Organizations usually have rigorous policies and procedures associated with procurements. The policies identify who has authority to enter into a contract, the limits of authority, and the processes and procedures that should be followed.\nPrior to conducting a procurement, the project manager and technically qualified project team members work with contracting professionals to develop the request for proposals (RFP), statement of work (SOW), terms and conditions, and other necessary documents to go out to bid.\n2.5.6.1 The Bid Process\nThe bid process includes developing and publicizing bid documents, bidder conferences, and selecting a bidder.\nBid documents can include:\n▶ Request for information. A request for information is used to gather more information from the market prior to sending out bid documents to a set of selected vendors.\n▶ Request for proposal. This bid document is used for complex or complicated scope where the buyer is looking for the vendor to provide a solution.\n▶ Request for quote. This bid document is used when price is the main deciding factor, and the proposed solution is readily available.\nThese three types cover the majority of bidding needs. There are other bid documents; however, they tend to be industry specific.\nOnce the bid documents are distributed, the buyer generally has a bidder conference to respond to bidder questions and provide clarifying information. Then the bidders develop their responses and deliver them to the buyer by the date specified in the bid documents.\nChoosing the best vendor, sometimes known as source selection, is often based on a number of criteria, such as experience, references, price, and timely delivery. These variables may be weighted to reflect the relative importance of each. The buyer evaluates vendor bids against the criteria to select an appropriate vendor(s). The buyer and vendor negotiate terms and conditions. Most everything can be negotiated, from cost to delivery and payment dates, to location of work, ownership of intellectual property, and so forth.\n2.5.6.2 Contracting\nEventually, the parties reach agreement and enter into a contract. The type of contracting vehicle depends on the size of the purchase, the stability of the scope of work, and the risk tolerances of the organizations.\nFor projects that use an adaptive approach for some deliverables and a predictive approach for others, a master agreement may be used for the overall contract. The adaptive work may be placed in an appendix or supplement. This allows the changes to occur on the adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract.\nOnce the vendor is selected, the project plans and documents are updated to incorporate vendor dates, resources, costs, quality requirements, risks, etc. From that point, the vendor becomes a project stakeholder. Information in the Stakeholders Performance Domain and Measurement Performance Domain will apply to the vendor(s) throughout the project.\nProcurements can take place at any point during the project. All procurement activities are integrated into the project operations.\n2.5.7 MONITORING NEW WORK AND CHANGES\nIn adaptive projects, there is an expectation that work will evolve and adapt. As a result, new work can be added to the product backlog, as needed. However, if more work is added than is being completed, or if the same amount of work is added that is being completed, the project will continue without end. The project manager works with the product owner to manage expectations around adding scope, the implications to the budget, and the availability of project team members. The product owner prioritizes the project backlog on an ongoing basis so that high-priority items are completed. If the schedule or budget is constrained, the product owner may consider the project done when the highest priority items are delivered.\nIn predictive projects, the project team actively manages changes to the work to ensure only approved changes are included in the scope baseline. Any changes to the scope are then accompanied by appropriate changes to the people, resources, schedule, and budget. Scope changes can add to uncertainty; therefore, any change requests should be accompanied by an evaluation of any new risks that are introduced due to the addition to or change in scope. The project manager works with the change control board and the change requestor to guide change requests through the change control process. Approved changes are integrated into the applicable project planning documents, product backlog, and project scope. The changes are also communicated to the appropriate stakeholders.\n2.5.8 LEARNING THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT\nPeriodically, the project team may meet to determine what they can do better in the future (lessons learned) and how they can improve and challenge the process in upcoming iterations (retrospectives). Ways of working can evolve to produce better outcomes.\n2.5.8.1 Knowledge Management\nA lot of learning takes place during projects. Some of the learning is project specific, such as a faster way to accomplish specific work. Some learning can be shared with other project teams to improve outcomes, such as a quality assurance approach that results in fewer defects. Still other learning can be shared throughout the organization, such as training users how to work with a new software application.\n2.5.8.2 Explicit and Tacit Knowledge\nThroughout the project, project teams develop and share explicit knowledge. Explicit knowledge can be readily codified using words, pictures, or numbers. For example, the steps to a new process are explicit knowledge that can be documented. Explicit knowledge can be distributed using information management tools to connect people to information, such as manuals, registers, web searches, and databases.\nAnother type of knowledge is tacit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is challenging to express as it cannot be codified. Tacit knowledge is comprised of experience, insights, and practical knowledge or skill. Tacit knowledge is shared by connecting the people who need the knowledge with people who have the knowledge. This can be accomplished via networking, interviews, job shadowing, discussion forums, workshops, or other similar methods.\nBecause projects are temporary endeavors, much of the knowledge is lost once the project is completed. Being attentive to knowledge transfer serves the organization by not only delivering the value that the project was undertaken to achieve, it also allows the organization to gain knowledge from the experience of running projects.\n2.5.9 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Project Work Performance Domain interacts and enables other performance domains on the project. Project work enables and supports efficient and effective planning, delivery, and measurement. It provides the environment for project team meetings, interactions, and stakeholder engagement to be effective. Project work supports navigating uncertainty, ambiguity, and complexity; and it balances their impacts with the other project constraints.\n2.5.10 CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-7 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right."

      "subsubtopic": "2.6 DELIVERY PERFORMANCE DOMAIN",
      "content": "Projects support strategy execution and the advancement of business objectives. Project delivery focuses on meeting requirements, scope, and quality expectations to produce the expected deliverables that will drive the intended outcomes.\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Delivery Performance Domain:\nRequirement. A condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy a business need.\nWork Breakdown Structure (WBS). A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.\nDefinition of Done (DoD). A checklist of all the criteria required to be met so that a deliverable can be considered ready for customer use.\nQuality. The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements.\nCost of Quality (COQ). All costs incurred over the life of the product by investment in preventing nonconformance to requirements, appraisal of the product or service for conformance to requirements, and failure to meet requirements.\nProjects provide business value by developing new products or services, solving problems, or fixing features that were defective or suboptimal. Projects often deliver multiple outcomes that stakeholders may value differently. For example, one group may value ease of use or the time-saving aspects of a deliverable while another group values its economic return or market differentiation.\n2.6.1 DELIVERY OF VALUE\nProjects that use a development approach that supports releasing deliverables throughout the project life cycle can start delivering value to the business, customer, or other stakeholders during the project. Projects that deliver the bulk of their deliverable at the end of the project life cycle generate value after the initial deployment.\nBusiness value often continues to be captured long after the initial project has ended. Frequently, longer product and program life cycles are used to measure the benefits and value contributed by earlier projects.\nA business case document often provides the business justification and a projection of anticipated business value from a project. The format of this business case varies based on the development approach and life cycle selected. Examples include business case documents with detailed estimates of return on investment or a lean, start-up canvas that describes high-level elements such as the problem, solution, revenue streams, and cost structures. These business documents demonstrate how the project outcomes align with the organization's business objectives.\nProject-authorizing documents attempt to quantify the project's desired outcomes to allow for periodic measurement. These documents may range from detailed, baselined plans or high-level roadmaps that provide an overview of the project life cycle, major releases, key deliverables, reviews, and other top-level information.\n2.6.2 DELIVERABLES\nIn this context, deliverable refers to the interim or final product, service, or results from a project. The deliverables enable the outcomes that the project was undertaken to create. Deliverables reflect the stakeholder requirements, scope, and quality, along with the long-term impacts to profit, people, and the planet.\n2.6.2.1 Requirements\nA requirement is a condition or capability that is necessary to be present in a product, service, or result to satisfy a business need. Requirements can be very high level, such as those found in a business case, or they can be very detailed, such as those found in acceptance criteria for a component of a system.\nProjects that have a well-defined scope, which is relatively stable, generally work with project stakeholders to elicit and document the requirements during up-front planning. Projects that have a high-level understanding of the requirements at the start of a project may evolve those requirements over time. Some projects discover requirements during project work.\n▶ Requirements elicitation. To elicit means to draw out, bring forth, or evoke. There is more to collecting requirements than interviewing or conducting focus groups. Sometimes requirements are drawn out by analyzing data, observing processes, reviewing defect logs, or other methods.\nPart of eliciting requirements is documenting them and gaining stakeholder agreement. Well-documented requirements meet the following criteria:\n▷ Clear. There is only one way to interpret the requirement.\n▷ Concise. The requirement is stated in as few words as possible.\n▷ Verifiable. There is a way to verify that the requirement has been met.\n▷ Consistent. There are no contradictory requirements.\n▷ Complete. The set of requirements represents the entirety of the current project or product needs.\n▷ Traceable. Each requirement can be recognized by a unique identifier.\n▶ Evolving and discovering requirements. On projects that do not have clearly defined requirements up front, prototypes, demonstrations, storyboards, and mock-ups can be used to evolve the requirements. In these situations, stakeholders are more likely to take an “I'll know it when I see it” approach to developing requirements. Evolving requirements are common in projects using iterative, incremental, or adaptive development approaches. In some cases, new opportunities arise that change requirements.\n▶ Managing requirements. Regardless of whether requirements are documented up front, evolved along the way, or discovered, there is a need to manage them. Ineffective requirements management can lead to rework, scope creep, customer dissatisfaction, budget overruns, schedule delay, and overall project failure. Therefore, many projects have one accountable person for requirements management. This person may serve as business analyst, product owner, value engineer, or other title. Those individuals managing requirements may use specialized software, backlogs, index cards, traceability matrices, or some other method to ensure there is an appropriate level of requirement flexibility versus stability, and that new and changing requirements are agreed to by all relevant stakeholders.\n2.6.2.2 Scope Definition\nAs requirements are identified, the scope that will meet them is defined. Scope is the sum of the products, services, and results to be provided as a project. As scope is defined, it creates the need for more requirements identification. Therefore, like requirements, scope can be well defined up front, it can evolve over time, or it can be discovered.\n▶ Scope decomposition. Scope can be elaborated using a scope statement to identify the major deliverables associated with the project and the acceptance criteria for each deliverable. Scope can also be elaborated by decomposing it into lower levels of detail using a work breakdown structure (WBS). A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. Each level down in the hierarchy represents a greater level of detail of the deliverable and work required to produce it.\nAnother way to elaborate scope is by identifying the themes of the project in an agile charter, roadmap, or as part of the product hierarchy. Themes represent large groups of customer value reflected as user stories associated by a common factor, such as functionality, data source, or security level. To accomplish themes, the project team develops epics, which are logical containers for a large user story that is too big to complete within an iteration. Epics may be decomposed into features, a set of related requirements typically described as a short phrase or function, which represent specific behaviors of a product. Each feature will have multiple user stories. A user story is a brief description of an outcome for a specific user, which is a promise for a conversation to clarify details. The project team defines story details at the last responsible moment to avoid wasteful planning should the scope change. The story is a clear and concise representation of a requirement written from the end user's perspective.\n▶ Completion of deliverables. Depending on the approach used, there are different ways to describe component or project completion:\n▷ Acceptance or completion criteria. The criteria required to be met before the customer accepts the deliverable or before the project is considered complete are often documented in a scope statement.\n▷ Technical performance measures. The technical specifications for a product may be documented in a separate specifications document, or they may be documented as an extension to the WBS. This extension, known as a WBS dictionary, elaborates the information for each deliverable (work package) in the WBS.\n▷ Definition of done. The definition of done is used with adaptive approaches, particularly in software development projects. It is a checklist of all the criteria required to be met so that a deliverable can be considered ready for customer use.\n2.6.2.3 Moving Targets of Completion\nProjects that operate in uncertain and rapidly changing environments face the situation that a “good enough for release” or “done” goal may be subject to change. In markets where competitors are releasing new products frequently, the features planned for a new release may be updated. Likewise, new technology trends, such as mobile devices or wearable devices, might trigger a change in direction or introduce new requirements.\nIn these environments, the definition of the project goal being delivered or “done” is constantly moving. Project teams track the planned rate of project goal achievement relative to the rate of progress toward completion. The longer the project takes to complete, the further the project goal of “done” is likely to move. This is sometimes referred to as “done drift.”\nFigure 2-21 shows a scenario for developing a new smart watch. The initial schedule shows 12 months to develop the watch with the initial set of capabilities and features. As competitors launch similar products, the initial set of capabilities and features increases to stay relevant with the market. This pushes the launch date to Month 14. At 13 months, another competitor launches a product with even more capabilities. Adding these capabilities would delay the launch to Month 16. At some point, a decision will be made whether to release the product as is, even though it doesn't have the latest features, or continue to update the features prior to launch.\nProjects that operate in a more stable environment often face “scope creep.” This is when additional scope or requirements are accepted without adjusting the corresponding schedule, budget, or resource needs. To combat scope creep, project teams use a change control system where all changes are evaluated for the potential value they bring to the project and the potential resources, time, and budget needed to realize the potential value. The project team then presents the changes to the project governance body, product owner, or executive sponsor for formal approval.\n2.6.3 QUALITY\nDelivery is more than just scope and requirements. Scope and requirements focus on what needs to be delivered. Quality focuses on the performance levels that are required to be met. Quality requirements may be reflected in the completion criteria, definition of done, statement of work, or requirements documentation.\nMuch of the costs associated with quality are born by the sponsoring organization and are reflected in policies, procedures, and work processes. For example, organizational policies that govern how work is performed and procedures that prescribe work processes are often part of the organization's quality policy. The cost of overhead, training, and process audit are born by the organization, though they are employed by the project. Inherent in projects is balancing the quality needs of the processes and products with the costs associated with meeting those needs.\n2.6.3.1 Cost of Quality\nThe cost of quality (COQ) methodology is used to find the appropriate balance for investing in quality prevention and appraisal to avoid defect or product failures. This model identifies four categories of costs associated with quality: prevention, appraisal, internal failure, and external failure. Prevention and appraisal costs are associated with the cost of compliance to quality requirements. Internal and external failure costs are associated with the cost of noncompliance.\n▶ Prevention. Prevention costs are incurred to keep defects and failures out of a product. Prevention costs avoid quality problems. They are associated with the design, implementation, and maintenance of the quality management system. They are planned and incurred before actual operation. Examples include:\n▷ Product or service requirements, such as the establishment of specifications for incoming materials, processes, finished products, and services;\n▷ Quality planning, such as the creation of plans for quality, reliability, operations, production, and inspection;\n▷ Quality assurance, such as the creation and maintenance of the quality system; and\n▷ Training, such as the development, preparation, and maintenance of programs.\n▶ Appraisal. Appraisal costs are incurred to determine the degree of conformance to quality requirements. Appraisal costs are associated with measuring and monitoring activities related to quality. These costs may be associated with evaluation of purchased materials, processes, products, and services to ensure that they conform to specifications. They could include:\n▷ Verification, such as checking incoming material, process setup, and products against agreed specifications;\n▷ Quality audits, such as confirmation that the quality system is functioning correctly; and\n▷ Supplier rating, such as assessment and approval of suppliers of products and services.\n▶ Internal Failure. Internal failure costs are associated with finding and correcting defects before the customer receives the product. These costs are incurred when the results of work fail to reach design quality standards. Examples include:\n▷ Waste, such as performance of unnecessary work or holding enough stock to account for errors, poor organization, or communication;\n▷ Scrap, such as defective product or material that cannot be repaired, used, or sold;\n▷ Rework or rectification, such as correction of defective material or errors; and\n▷ Failure analysis, such as activities required to establish the causes of internal product or service failure.\n▶ External Failure. External failure costs are associated with defects found after the customer has the product and with remediation. Note that to consider these failures holistically requires thinking about the project's product while it is in operation after months or years, not just at the handover date. External failure costs occur when products or services that fail to reach design quality standards are not detected until after they have reached the customer. Examples include:\n▷ Repairs and servicing, for both returned products and those that are deployed;\n▷ Warranty claims, such as failed products that are replaced or services that are reperformed under a guarantee;\n▷ Complaints, for all work and costs associated with handling and servicing customers’ complaints;\n▷ Returns, for handling and investigation of rejected or recalled products, including transport costs; and\n▷ Reputation, where reputation and public perception can be damaged depending on the type and severity of defects.\nTo optimize delivered value, early inspection and review work focused on finding quality issues as soon as possible are good investments. Attempts to “test-quality-in” late in the development life cycle are likely to fail because discovering quality issues late in development is time- and cost prohibitive due to high rates of scrap and rework, along with the ripple effect to downstream outputs and stakeholders.\n2.6.3.2 Cost of Change\nThe later a defect is found, the more expensive it is to correct. This is because design and development work have typically already occurred based on the flawed component. Also, activities are more costly to modify as the life cycle progresses since more stakeholders are impacted. This phenomenon is characterized by the cost of change curve (see Figure 2-22).\nTo counter the impacts of the cost of change curve, project teams design project processes to build in quality. This approach can include quality analysts working with designers and engineers to understand and determine how best to achieve quality during each step in the project life cycle. Being proactive about quality work helps avoid the high cost of change associated with fixing quality issues discovered later in the life cycle. It is quicker and more cost efficient to fix a design problem between two engineers than a component problem affecting hundreds of units or to recall a product impacting thousands of customers.\n2.6.4 SUBOPTIMAL OUTCOMES\nAll projects attempt to deliver outcomes, though some may fail to do so or may produce suboptimal outcomes. The potential for suboptimal outcomes exists in every project. In the case of a fully experimental project, the organization is attempting to achieve a breakthrough, such as the creation of a completely new technology, for example. This requires deliberate investment in an uncertain outcome. Companies that produce new medicines or compounds may experience several failures before finding a successful formula. Some projects may fail to deliver outcomes because the market opportunity has passed or competitors were first to market with their offering. Effective project management can minimize negative outcomes, but such possibilities are part of the uncertainty of attempting to produce a unique deliverable.\n2.6.5 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Delivery Performance Domain is the culmination of the work done in the Planning Performance Domain. The delivery cadence is based on the way work is structured in the Development Approach and Life Cycle Performance Domain. The Project Work Performance Domain enables the deliveries by establishing processes, managing physical resources, managing procurements, and so forth. Project team members perform the work in this performance domain for the relevant stakeholders. The nature of the work to create the deliveries will influence how the project team navigates uncertainty that impacts the project.\n2.6.6 CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-8 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right."

      "subtopic": "2 Project Performance Domains",
      "subsubtopic": "2.7 MEASUREMENT PERFORMANCE DOMAIN",
      "content": "Measurement involves assessing project performance and implementing appropriate responses to maintain optimal performance.\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Measurement Performance Domain:\nMetric. A description of a project or product attribute and how to measure it.\nBaseline. The approved version of a work product used as a basis for comparison to actual results.\nDashboard. A set of charts and graphs showing progress or performance against important measures of the project.\nThe Measurement Performance Domain evaluates the degree to which the work done in the Delivery Performance Domain is meeting the metrics identified in the Planning Performance Domain. For example, performance can be measured and evaluated using baselines identified in the Planning Performance Domain. Having timely and accurate information about project work and performance allows the project team to learn and determine the appropriate action to take to address current or expected variances from the desired performance.\nMeasures are used for multiple reasons, including:\n▶ Evaluating performance compared to plan;\n▶ Tracking the utilization of resources, work completed, budget expended, etc.;\n▶ Demonstrating accountability;\n▶ Providing information to stakeholders;\n▶ Assessing whether project deliverables are on track to deliver planned benefits;\n▶ Focusing conversations about trade-offs, threats, opportunities, and options; and\n▶ Ensuring the project deliverables will meet customer acceptance criteria.\nThe value of measurements is not in the collection and dissemination of the data, but rather in the conversations about how to use the data to take appropriate action. Therefore, while much of this performance domain addresses various types of measurements that can be captured, use of the measures occurs within the context of activities in other performance domains, such as project team and stakeholder discussions, coordinating project work, and so forth.\nThis performance domain focuses on measures for active projects. A portfolio leader may want to include measures that address the success of the project after it is completed, such as whether the project delivered the intended outcomes and benefits. Portfolio leaders may assess if the project outcome increased customer satisfaction, decreased cost per unit, or other measures that are not available until after the project has closed. Similarly, business managers may assess the project from the perspective of the value the outcome brings to the organization. Business measures might include the increase in market share, increase in profit, or decrease in cost per unit. The Measurement Performance Domain addresses measures and metrics that are used during the project.\n2.7.1 ESTABLISHING EFFECTIVE MEASURES\nEstablishing effective measures helps to ensure the right things are measured and reported to stakeholders. Effective measures allow for tracking, evaluating, and reporting information that can communicate project status, help improve project performance, and reduce the likelihood of performance deterioration. These measures allow the project team to use information to make timely decisions and take effective actions.\n2.7.1.1 Key Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) for projects are quantifiable measures used to evaluate the success of a project. There are two types of KPIs: leading indicators and lagging indicators.\n▶ Leading indicators. Leading indicators predict changes or trends in the project. If the change or trend is unfavorable, the project team evaluates the root cause of the leading indicator measurement and takes actions to reverse the trend. Used in this way, leading indicators can reduce performance risk on a project by identifying potential performance variances before they cross the tolerance threshold.\nLeading indicators may be quantifiable, such as the size of the project or the number of items that are in progress in the backlog. Other leading indicators are more difficult to quantify, but they provide early warning signs of potential problems. The lack of a risk management process, stakeholders who are not available or engaged, or poorly defined project success criteria are all examples of leading indicators that project performance may be at risk.\n▶ Lagging indicators. Lagging indicators measure project deliverables or events. They provide information after the fact. Lagging indicators reflect past performance or conditions. Lagging indicators are easier to measure than leading indicators. Examples include the number of deliverables completed, the schedule or cost variance, and the amount of resources consumed.\nLagging indicators can also be used to find correlations between outcomes and environmental variables. For example, a lagging indicator that shows a schedule variance may show a correlation with project team member dissatisfaction. This correlation can assist the project team in addressing a root cause that may not have been obvious if the only measure was schedule status.\nIn and of themselves, KPIs are simply measures that have no real use unless and until they are used. Discussing leading and lagging indicators and identifying areas for improvement, as appropriate, can have a positive impact on performance.\n2.7.1.2 Effective Metrics\nMeasuring takes time and effort, which could otherwise be spent on other productive work; therefore, project teams should only measure what is relevant and should ensure that the metrics are useful. Characteristics of effective metrics (or SMART criteria) include:\n▶ Specific. Measurements are specific as to what to measure. Examples include the number of defects, the defects that have been fixed, or the average time it takes to fix defects.\n▶ Meaningful. Measures should be tied to the business case, baselines, or requirements. It is not efficient to measure product attributes or project performance that do not lead to meeting objectives or improving performance.\n▶ Achievable. The target is achievable given the people, technology, and environment.\n▶ Relevant. Measures should be relevant. The information provided by the measure should provide value and allow for actionable information.\n▶ Timely. Useful measurements are timely. Information that is old is not as useful as fresh information. Forward-looking information, such as emerging trends, can help project teams change direction and make better decisions.\nThe SMART acronym described previously can use alternative terms. For example, some people prefer “measurable” instead of meaningful, “agreed to” instead of achievable, “realistic” or “reasonable” instead of relevant, and “time bound” instead of timely.\n2.7.2 WHAT TO MEASURE\nWhat is measured, the parameters, and the measurement method depend on the project objectives, the intended outcomes, and the environment in which the project takes place. Common categories of metrics include:\n▶ Deliverable metrics,\n▶ Delivery,\n▶ Baseline performance,\n▶ Resources,\n▶ Business value,\n▶ Stakeholders, and\n▶ Forecasts.\nA balanced set of metrics helps to provide a holistic picture of the project, its performance, and its outcomes.\nSections 2.7.2.1 through 2.7.2.7 provide a brief description of these categories.\n2.7.2.1 Deliverable Metrics\nBy necessity, the products, services, or results being delivered determine the useful measures. Customary measures include:\n▶ Information on errors or defects. This measure includes the source of defects, number of defects identified, and number of defects resolved.\n▶ Measures of performance. Measures of performance characterize physical or functional attributes relating to the system operation. Examples include size, weight, capacity, accuracy, reliability, efficiency, and similar performance measures.\n▶ Technical performance measures. Quantifiable measures of technical performance are used to ensure system components meet technical requirements. They provide insights into progress in achieving the technical solution.\n2.7.2.2 Delivery\nDelivery measurements are associated with work in progress. These measures are frequently used in projects using adaptive approaches.\n▶ Work in progress. This measure indicates the number of work items that are being worked on at any given time. It is used to help the project team limit the number of items in progress to a manageable size.\n▶ Lead time. This measure indicates the amount of elapsed time from a story or chunk of work entering the backlog to the end of the iteration or the release. Lower lead time indicates a more effective process and a more productive project team.\n▶ Cycle time. Related to lead time, cycle time indicates the amount of time it takes the project team to complete a task. Shorter times indicate a more productive project team. A consistent time helps predict the possible rate of work in the future.\n▶ Queue size. This measure tracks the number of items in a queue. This metric can be compared to the work in progress limit. Little's Law states that queue size is proportional to both the rate of arrival in the queue and the rate of completion of items from the queue. One can gain insights into completion times by measuring work in progress and developing a forecast for future work completion.\n▶ Batch size. Batch size measures the estimated amount of work (level of effort, story points, etc.) that is expected to be completed in an iteration.\n▶ Process efficiency. Process efficiency is a ratio used in lean systems to optimize the flow of work. This measure calculates the ratio between value-adding time and non-value-adding activities. Tasks that are waiting increase the non-value-adding time. Tasks that are in development or in verification represent value-adding time. Higher ratios indicate a more efficient process.\n2.7.2.3 Baseline Performance\nThe most common baselines are cost and schedule. Projects that track a scope or technical baseline can use information in the deliverable measures.\nMost schedule measures track actual performance to planned performance related to:\n▶ Start and finish dates. Comparing the actual start dates to the planned start dates and the actual finish dates to the planned finish dates can measure the extent to which work is accomplished as planned. Even if work is not on the longest path through the project (the critical path), late start and finish dates indicate that the project is not performing to plan.\n▶ Effort and duration. Actual effort and duration compared to planned effort and duration indicates whether estimates for the amount of work and the time the work takes are valid.\n▶ Schedule variance (SV). A simple schedule variance is determined by looking at performance on the critical path. When used with earned value management, it is the difference between the earned value and the planned value. Figure 2-24 shows an earned value graph illustrating the schedule variance.\n▶ Schedule performance index (SPI). Schedule performance index is an earned value management measure that indicates how efficiently the scheduled work is being performed.\n▶ Feature completion rates. Examining the rate of feature acceptance during frequent reviews can help assess progress and estimate completion dates and costs.\nCommon cost measures include:\n▶ Actual cost compared to planned cost. This cost measure compares the actual cost for labor or resources to the estimated cost. This term may be referred to as the burn rate.\n▶ Cost variance (CV). A simple cost variance is determined by comparing the actual cost of a deliverable to the estimated cost. When used with earned value management, it is the difference between the earned value and the actual cost. Figure 2-24 shows an earned value graph illustrating the cost variance.\n▶ Cost performance index (CPI). An earned value management measure that indicates how efficiently the work is being performed with regard to the budgeted cost of the work.\n2.7.2.4 Resources\nResource measurements may be a subset of cost measurements since resource variances frequently lead to cost variances. The two measures evaluate price variance and usage variance. Measures include:\n▶ Planned resource utilization compared to actual resource utilization. This measurement compares the actual usage of resources to the estimated usage. A usage variance is calculated by subtracting the planned usage from the actual usage.\n▶ Planned resource cost compared to actual resource cost. This measurement compares the actual cost of resources to the estimated cost. Price variance is calculated by subtracting the estimated cost from the actual cost.\n2.7.2.5 Business Value\nBusiness value measurements are used to ensure the project deliverable stays aligned to the business case and the benefits realization plans. Business value has many aspects—both financial and nonfinancial. Metrics that measure financial business value include:\n▶ Cost-benefit ratio. This is a measure of the expected present value of an investment with the initial cost. The cost-benefit ratio is used to determine if the costs of a project outweigh its benefits. If the costs are greater than the benefits, the result will be greater than 1.0. In this case, the project should not be considered unless there are regulatory, social good, or other reasons to do the project. A similar measure is a benefit-cost ratio. The same measures are used, but the benefits are in the numerator and the costs are in the denominator. For this measure, if the ratio is greater than 1.0, the project should be considered.\n▶ Planned benefits delivery compared to actual benefits delivery. As part of a business case, organizations may identify value as the benefit that will be delivered as a result of doing the project. For projects that expect to deliver benefits during the project life cycle, measuring the benefits delivered and the value of those benefits, then comparing that information to the business case, provides information that can justify the continuation of the project, or in some cases, the cancellation of the project.\n▶ Return on investment (ROI). A measure of the amount of financial return compared to the cost, ROI is generally developed as an input to the decision to undertake a project. There may be estimates of ROI at different points in time across the project life cycle. By measuring ROI throughout the project, the project team can determine if it makes sense to continue the investment of organizational resources.\n▶ Net present value (NPV). The difference between the present value of inflows of capital and the present value of outflows of capital over a period of time, NPV is generally developed when deciding to undertake a project. By measuring the NPV throughout the project, the project team can determine if it makes sense to continue the investment of organizational resources.\n2.7.2.6 Stakeholders\nStakeholder satisfaction can be measured with surveys or by inferring satisfaction, or lack thereof, and by looking at related metrics, such as:\n▶ Net Promoter Score® (NPS®). A Net Promoter Score measures the degree to which a stakeholder (usually the customer) is willing to recommend a product or service to others. It measures a range from -100 to +100. A high Net Promoter Score not only measures satisfaction with a brand, product, or service, it is also an indicator of customer loyalty.\n▶ Mood chart. A mood chart can track the mood or reactions of a group of very important stakeholders—the project team. At the end of each day, project team members can use colors, numbers, or emojis to indicate their frame of mind. Figure 2-25 shows a mood chart using emojis. Tracking the project team's mood or individual project team member's moods can help to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.\n▶ Morale. Since mood boards can be subjective, another option is to measure project team morale. This can be done by surveys, asking project team members to rate their agreement on a scale of 1 to 5 to statements such as:\n▷ I feel my work contributes to the overall outcomes.\n▷ I feel appreciated.\n▷ I am satisfied with the way my project team works together.\n▶ Turnover. Another way to track morale is by looking at unplanned project team turnover. High rates of unplanned turnover may indicate low morale.\n2.7.2.7 Forecasts\nProject teams use forecasts to consider what might happen in the future so they can consider and discuss whether to adapt plans and project work accordingly. Forecasts can be qualitative, such as using expert judgment about what the future will hold. They can also be causal when seeking to understand the impact a specific event or condition will have on future events. Quantitative forecasts seek to use past information to estimate what will happen in the future. Quantitative forecasts include:\n▶ Estimate to complete (ETC).3 An earned value management measure that forecasts the expected cost to finish all the remaining project work. There are many different ways to calculate the estimate to complete. Assuming past performance is indicative of future performance, a common measurement is calculation of the budget at completion minus the earned value, then dividing by the cost performance index. For more calculations to determine the ETC, see The Standard for Earned Value Management [2].\n▶ Estimate at completion (EAC). This earned value management measure forecasts the expected total cost of completing all work (see Figure 2-26). There are many different ways to calculate the estimate at completion. Assuming past performance is indicative of future performance, a common measurement is the budget at completion divided by the cost performance index. For more calculations to determine the EAC, see The Standard for Earned Value Management [2].\n▶ Variance at completion (VAC). An earned value management measure that forecasts the amount of budget deficit or surplus. It is expressed as the difference between the budget at completion (BAC) and the estimate at completion (EAC).\n▶ To-complete performance index (TCPI). An earned value management measure that estimates the cost performance required to meet a specified management goal. TCPI is expressed as the ratio of the cost to finish the outstanding work to the remaining budget.\n▶ Regression analysis. An analytical method where a series of input variables are examined in relation to their corresponding output results in order to develop a mathematical or statistical relationship. The relationship can be used to infer future performance.\n▶ Throughput analysis. This analytical method assesses the number of items being completed in a fixed time frame. Project teams that use adaptive practices use throughput metrics such as features complete vs. features remaining, velocity, and story points to evaluate their progress and estimate likely completion dates. Using duration estimates and burn rates of stable project teams can help verify and update cost estimates.\n2.7.3 PRESENTING INFORMATION\nThe measures being collected are important, but what is done with the measures is just as important. For information to be useful, it has to be timely, accessible, easy to absorb and digest, and presented so that it correctly conveys the degree of uncertainty associated with the information. Visual displays with graphics can help stakeholders absorb and make sense of information.\n2.7.3.1 Dashboards\nA common way of showing large quantities of information on metrics is a dashboard. Dashboards generally collect information electronically and generate charts that depict status. Often, dashboards offer high-level summaries of data and allow drill-down analysis into contributing data. Figure 2-27 provides an example of a dashboard.\nDashboards often include information displayed as stoplight charts (also known as RAG charts where RAG is an abbreviation for red-amber-green), bar charts, pie charts, and control charts. A text explanation can be used for any measures that are outside the established thresholds.\n2.7.3.2 Information Radiators\nInformation radiators, also known as big visible charts (BVCs), are visible, physical displays that provide information to the rest of the organization, enabling timely knowledge sharing. They are posted in a place where people can see the information easily, rather than having information in a scheduling or reporting tool. BVCs should be easy to update, and they should be updated frequently. They are often “low tech and high touch” in that they are manually maintained rather than electronically generated. Figure 2-28 shows an information radiator associated with work completed, work remaining, and risks.\n2.7.3.3 Visual Controls\nIn lean environments, information radiators are known as visual controls. Visual controls illustrate processes to easily compare actual against expected performance. Visual controls show a process using visual cues. Visual controls can be present for all levels of information from business value delivered to tasks that have started. They should be highly visible for anyone to see.\n▶ Task boards. A task board is a visual representation of the planned work that allows everyone to see the status of the tasks. A task board can show work that is ready to be started (to do), work in progress, and work that is completed (see Figure 2-29).\nA task board allows anyone to see at a glance the status of a particular task or the number of tasks in each stage of work. Different color sticky notes can represent different types of work, and dots can be used to show how many days a task has been in its current position.\nFlow-based projects, such as those that use kanban boards, can use these charts to limit the amount of work in progress. If a column is approaching the work in progress limit, project team members can “swarm” around the current work to help those working on tasks that are slowing the flow.\n▶ Burn charts. Burn charts, such as a burnup or burndown charts, can show project team velocity. Velocity measures the productivity rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted within a predefined interval. A burnup chart can track the amount of work done compared to the expected work that should be done (see Figure 2-30). A burndown chart can show the number of story points remaining or the amount of risk exposure that has been reduced.\n▶ Other types of charts. Visual charts can also include information such as an impediment list that shows a description of the impediment to getting work done, the severity, and the actions being taken to resolve the impediment.\n2.7.4 MEASUREMENT PITFALLS\nProject measures help the project team meet the project objectives. However, there are some pitfalls associated with measurement. Awareness of these pitfalls can help minimize their negative effect.\n▶ Hawthorne effect. The Hawthorne effect states that the very act of measuring something influences behavior. Therefore, take care in establishing metrics. For example, measuring only a project team's output of deliverables can encourage the project team to focus on creating a large volume of deliverables rather than focusing on deliverables that would provide higher customer satisfaction.\n▶ Vanity metric. A vanity metric is a measure that shows data but does not provide useful information for making decisions. Measuring pageviews of a website is not as useful as measuring the number of new viewers.\n▶ Demoralization. If measures and goals are set that are not achievable, project team morale may fall as they continuously fail to meet targets. Setting stretch goals and aspirational measures is acceptable, but people also want to see their hard work recognized. Unrealistic or unachievable goals can be counterproductive.\n▶ Misusing the metrics. Regardless of the metrics used to measure performance, there is the opportunity for people to distort the measurements or focus on the wrong thing. Examples include:\n▷ Focusing on less important metrics rather than the metrics that matter most,\n▷ Focusing on performing well for the short-term measures at the expense of long-term metrics, and\n▷ Working on out-of-sequence activities that are easy to accomplish in order to improve performance indicators.\n▶ Confirmation bias. As human beings, we tend to look for and see information that supports our preexisting point of view. This can lead us to false interpretations of data.\n▶ Correlation versus causation. A common mistake in interpreting measurement data is confusing the correlation of two variables with the idea that one causes the other. For example, seeing projects that are behind schedule and over budget might infer that projects that are over budget cause schedule issues. This is not true, nor is it true that projects that are behind schedule cause budget overruns. Instead, there are likely other correlating factors that are not being considered, such as skill in estimating, the ability to manage change, and actively managing risk.\nBeing aware of the pitfalls associated with metrics can help with establishing effective metrics in addition to being vigilant regarding the dangers associated with inappropriate measures.\n2.7.5 TROUBLESHOOTING PERFORMANCE\nPart of measurement is having agreed to plans for measures that are outside the threshold ranges. Thresholds can be established for a variety of metrics such as schedule, budget, velocity, and other project-specific measures. The degree of variance will depend on stakeholder risk tolerances.\nFigure 2-31 shows an example of a budget threshold set at +10% (orange) and -20% (green) of the predicted spend rate. The blue line is tracking the actual spend, and in January, it exceeded the +10% upper tolerance that would trigger the exception plan.\nIdeally, project teams should not wait until a threshold has been breached before taking action. If a breach can be forecasted via a trend or new information, the project team can be proactive in addressing the expected variance.\nAn exception plan is an agreed-upon set of actions to be taken if a threshold is crossed or forecast. Exception plans do not have to be formal; they can be as simple as calling a stakeholder meeting to discuss the matter. The importance of the exception plan is to discuss the issue and develop a plan for what needs to be done. Then follow through to make sure the plan is implemented and determine if the plan is working.\n2.7.6 GROWING AND IMPROVING\nThe intent in measuring and displaying data is to learn and improve. To optimize project performance and efficiency, only measure and report information that will:\n▶ Allow the project team to learn,\n▶ Facilitate a decision,\n▶ Improve some aspect of the product or project performance,\n▶ Help avoid an issue, and\n▶ Prevent performance deterioration.\nApplied appropriately, measurements facilitate the project team's ability to generate business value and achieve the project objectives and performance targets.\n2.7.7 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Measurement Performance Domain interacts with the Planning, Project Work, and Delivery Performance Domains as plans form the basis for comparing the deliveries to plan. The Measurement Performance Domain can support the activities that are part of the Planning Performance Domain by presenting up-to-date information so that lessons learned can reflect favorable or unfavorable information for updating plans. The Team and Stakeholder Performance Domains interact as project team members develop the plans and create the deliverables and deliveries that are measured.\nAs unpredictable events occur, both positive and negative, they have an impact on the project performance and therefore on the project measurements and metrics. Responding to changes caused by uncertain events that have occurred includes updating measurements that have been impacted due to the change. Activities in the Uncertainty Performance Domain, such as identifying risks and opportunities, can be initiated based on performance measurements.\nPart of the project work is working with the project team and other stakeholders to establish the metrics, gather the data, analyze the data, make decisions, and report on project status.\n2.7.8 CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-9 identifies the outcomes from effective application of the Measurement Performance Domain on the left and ways of checking them on the right."

      "content": "Projects exist in environments with varying degrees of uncertainty. Uncertainty presents threats and opportunities that project teams explore, assess, and decide how to handle.\nThe following definitions are relevant to the Uncertainty Performance Domain:\nUncertainty. A lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, or solutions to pursue.\nAmbiguity. A state of being unclear, having difficulty in identifying the cause of events, or having multiple options from which to choose.\nComplexity. A characteristic of a program or project or its environment that is difficult to manage due to human behavior, system behavior, and ambiguity.\nVolatility. The possibility for rapid and unpredictable change.\nRisk. An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.\nUncertainty in the broadest sense is a state of not knowing or unpredictability. There are many nuances to uncertainty, such as:\n▶ Risk associated with not knowing future events,\n▶ Ambiguity associated with not being aware of current or future conditions, and\n▶ Complexity associated with dynamic systems having unpredictable outcomes.\nSuccessfully navigating uncertainty begins with understanding the larger environment within which the project is operating. Aspects of the environment that contribute to project uncertainty include, but are not limited to:\n▶ Economic factors such as volatility in prices, availability of resources, ability to borrow funds, and inflation/deflation;\n▶ Technical considerations such as new or emerging technology, complexity associated with systems, and interfaces;\n▶ Legal or legislative constraints or requirements;\n▶ Physical environment as it pertains to safety, weather, and working conditions;\n▶ Ambiguity associated with current or future conditions;\n▶ Social and market influences shaped by opinion and media; and,\n▶ Political influences, either external or internal to the organization.\nThis performance domain addresses the various aspects of uncertainty, implications of uncertainty, such as project risk, as well as options for navigating the various forms of uncertainty.\n2.8.1 GENERAL UNCERTAINTY\nUncertainty is inherent in all projects. For this reason, the effects of any activity cannot be predicted precisely, and a range of outcomes can occur. Potential outcomes that benefit the project objectives are known as opportunities; potential outcomes that have a negative effect on objectives are called threats. Together, the set of opportunities and threats comprise the set of project risks. There are several options for responding to uncertainty:\n▶ Gather information. Sometimes uncertainty can be reduced by finding out more information, such as conducting research, engaging experts, or performing a market analysis. It is also important to recognize when further information collection and analysis exceed the benefit of having the additional information.\n▶ Prepare for multiple outcomes. In situations where there are only a few possible outcomes from an area of uncertainty, the project team can prepare for each of those outcomes. This entails having a primary solution available, as well as having backup or contingency plans in case the initial solution is not viable or effective. Where there is a large set of potential outcomes, the project team can categorize and assess the potential causes to estimate their likelihood of occurrence. This allows the project team to identify the most likely potential outcomes on which to focus.\n▶ Set-based design. Multiple designs or alternatives can be investigated early in the project to reduce uncertainty. This allows the project team to look at trade-offs, such as time versus cost, quality versus cost, risk versus schedule, or schedule versus quality. The intention is to explore options so the project team can learn from working with the various alternatives. Ineffective or suboptimal alternatives are discarded throughout the process.\n▶ Build in resilience. Resilience is the ability to adapt and respond quickly to unexpected changes. Resilience applies to both project team members and organizational processes. If the initial approach to product design or a prototype is not effective, the project team and the organization need to be able to learn, adapt, and respond quickly.\n2.8.2 AMBIGUITY\nThere are two categories of ambiguity: conceptual ambiguity and situational ambiguity. Conceptual ambiguity—the lack of effective understanding—occurs when people use similar terms or arguments in different ways. For example, the statement, “The schedule was reported on track last week,” is not clear. It isn't clear whether the schedule was on track last week or whether it was reported on last week. In addition, there could be some question as to what “on track” means. Ambiguity of this type can be reduced by formally establishing common rules and definitions of terms, such as what does “on track” mean.\nSituational ambiguity surfaces when more than one outcome is possible. Having multiple options to solve a problem is a form of situational ambiguity. Solutions for exploration of ambiguity include progressive elaboration, experimentation, and the use of prototypes.\n▶ Progressive elaboration. This is the iterative process of increasing the level of detail in a project management plan as greater amounts of information and more accurate estimates become available.\n▶ Experiments. A well-designed series of experiments can help identify cause-and-effect relationships or, at least, can reduce the amount of ambiguity.\n▶ Prototypes. Prototypes can help distinguish the relationships between different variables.\n2.8.3 COMPLEXITY\nComplexity is a characteristic of a program, project, or its environment, which is difficult to manage due to human behavior, system behavior, or ambiguity. Complexity exists when there are many interconnected influences that behave and interact in diverse ways. In complex environments, it is not uncommon to see an aggregation of individual elements leading to unforeseen or unintended outcomes. The effect of complexity is that there is no way of making accurate predictions about the likelihood of any potential outcome or even of knowing what outcomes might emerge. There are numerous ways to work with complexity; some of them are systems-based, some entail reframing, and others are based on process.\n2.8.3.1 Systems-Based\nExamples of working with complexity that is systems based include:\n▶ Decoupling. Decoupling entails disconnecting parts of the system to both simplify the system and reduce the number of connected variables. Determining how a piece of a system works on its own reduces the overall size of the problem.\n▶ Simulation. There may be similar though unrelated scenarios that can be used to simulate components of a system. A project to build a new airport that includes an area with shopping and restaurants can learn about consumer buying habits by seeking out analogous information on shopping malls and entertainment establishments.\n2.8.3.2 Reframing\nExamples of working with complexity that entail reframing are:\n▶ Diversity. Complex systems require viewing the system from diverse perspectives. This can include brainstorming with the project team to open up divergent ways of seeing the system. It can also include Delphi-like processes to move from divergent to convergent thinking.\n▶ Balance. Balancing the type of data used rather than only using forecasting data or data that report on the past or lagging indicators provides a broader perspective. This can include using elements whose variations are likely to counteract each other's potential negative effects.\n2.8.3.3 Process-Based\nExamples of working with complexity that is process based include:\n▶ Iterate. Build iteratively or incrementally. Add features one at a time. After each iteration, identify what worked, what did not work, customer reaction, and what the project team learned.\n▶ Engage. Build in opportunities to get stakeholder engagement. This reduces the number of assumptions and builds learning and engagement into the process.\n▶ Fail safe. For elements of a system that are critical, build in redundancy or elements that can provide a graceful degradation of functionality in the event of a critical component failure.\n2.8.4 VOLATILITY\nVolatility exists in an environment that is subject to rapid and unpredictable change. Volatility can occur when there are ongoing fluctuations in available skill sets or materials. Volatility usually impacts cost and schedule. Alternatives analysis and use of cost or schedule reserve address volatility.\n▶ Alternatives analysis. Finding and evaluating alternatives, such as looking at different ways to meet an objective, such as using a different mix of skills, resequencing work, or outsourcing work. Alternatives analysis may include identifying the variables to be considered in evaluating options, and the relative importance or weight of each variable.\n▶ Reserve. Cost reserve can be used to cover budget overruns due to price volatility. In some circumstances, schedule reserve can be used to address delays due to volatility associated with resource availability.\nEffectively navigating uncertainty, ambiguity, complexity, and volatility improves the ability to anticipate situations, make good decisions, plan, and solve problems.\n2.8.5 RISK\nRisks are an aspect of uncertainty. A risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives. Negative risks are called threats, and positive risks are called opportunities. All projects have risks since they are unique undertakings with varying degrees of uncertainty.\nProject team members should proactively identify risks throughout the project to avoid or minimize the impacts of threats and trigger or maximize the impacts of opportunities. Both threats and opportunities have a set of possible response strategies that can be planned for implementation should the risk occur.\nIn order to navigate risk effectively, the project team needs to know what level of risk exposure is acceptable in pursuit of the project objectives. This is defined by measurable risk thresholds that reflect the risk appetite and attitude of the organization and project stakeholders. Risk thresholds express the acceptable variation around an objective that reflects the risk appetite of the organization and stakeholders. Thresholds are typically stated and communicated to the project team and reflected in the definitions of risk impact levels for the project.\nOverall Project Risk\nOverall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole, arising from all sources of uncertainty. This includes individual risks and the exposure to the implications of variation in project outcome, both positive and negative. Overall risk is often a function of complexity, ambiguity, and volatility. Responses to overall project risk are the same as for individual threats and opportunities, though responses are applied to the overall project rather than to a specific event. If the overall risk on the project is too high, the organization may choose to cancel the project.\n2.8.5.1 Threats\nA threat is an event or condition that, if it occurs, has a negative impact on one or more objectives. Five alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with threats, as follows:\n▶ Avoid. Threat avoidance is when the project team acts to eliminate the threat or protect the project from its impact.\n▶ Escalate. Escalation is appropriate when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that a threat is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager's authority.\n▶ Transfer. Transfer involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and to bear the impact if the threat occurs.\n▶ Mitigate. In threat mitigation, action is taken to reduce the probability of occurrence and/or impact of a threat. Early mitigation action is often more effective than trying to repair the damage after the threat has occurred.\n▶ Accept. Threat acceptance acknowledges the existence of a threat, but no proactive action is planned. Actively accepting a risk can include developing a contingency plan that would be triggered if the event occurred; or it can include passive acceptance, which means doing nothing.\nA response to a specific threat might include multiple strategies. For example, if the threat cannot be avoided, it may be mitigated to a level at which it becomes viable to transfer or to accept it.\nThe goal of implementing threat responses is to reduce the amount of negative risk. Risks that are accepted sometimes are reduced simply by the passage of time or because the risk event does not occur. Figure 2-33 shows how risks are tracked and reduced over time.\n2.8.5.2 Opportunities\nAn opportunity is an event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive impact on one or more project objectives. An example of an opportunity could be a time and materials-based subcontractor who finishes work early, resulting in lower costs and schedule savings.\nFive alternative strategies may be considered for dealing with opportunities, as follows:\n▶ Exploit. A response strategy whereby the project team acts to ensure that an opportunity occurs.\n▶ Escalate. As with threats, this opportunity response strategy is used when the project team or the project sponsor agrees that an opportunity is outside the scope of the project or that the proposed response would exceed the project manager's authority.\n▶ Share. Opportunity sharing involves allocating ownership of an opportunity to a third party who is best able to capture the benefit of that opportunity.\n▶ Enhance. In opportunity enhancement, the project team acts to increase the probability of occurrence or impact of an opportunity. Early enhancement action is often more effective than trying to improve the opportunity after it has occurred.\n▶ Accept. As with threats, accepting an opportunity acknowledges its existence but no proactive action is planned.\nOnce a set of risk responses has been developed, it should be reviewed to see whether the planned responses have added any secondary risks. The review should also assess the residual risk that will remain once the response actions have been carried out. Response planning should be repeated until residual risk is compatible with the organization's risk appetite.\nTaking an economic view of work prioritization allows the team to prioritize threat avoidance and reduction activities.\nComparing the expected monetary value (EMV) of a risk to the anticipated return on investment (ROI) of a deliverable or feature allows the project manager to have conversations with sponsors or product owners about where and when to incorporate risks responses into the planned work (see Figure 2-34).\n2.8.5.3 Management and Contingency Reserve\nReserve is an amount of time or budget set aside to account for handling risks. Contingency reserve is set aside to address identified risks should they occur. Management reserve is a budget category used for unknown events such as unplanned, in-scope work.\n2.8.5.4 Risk Review\nEstablishing a frequent rhythm or cadence of review and feedback sessions from a broad selection of stakeholders is helpful for navigating project risk and being proactive with risk responses.\nDaily standup meetings can be used in any project and are a source for identifying potential threats and opportunities. Reports of blockers or impediments could become threats if they continue to delay progress. Likewise, reports of progress and breakthroughs might point toward opportunities to be further leveraged and shared.\nFrequent demonstrations of increments of the product or service, interim designs, or proof of concepts can surface threats and opportunities. Negative feedback from demonstrations or design reviews can be an early indicator of threats related to dissatisfaction from stakeholders if not corrected. Positive feedback helps inform the project team regarding the areas of development highly valued by the business representatives.\nAddressing risk at weekly status meetings ensures that risk management remains relevant. These meetings can be used to identify new risks as well as identify changes to existing risks.\nRetrospectives and lessons learned meetings can be used to identify threats to performance, project team cohesion, etc., and to seek improvements. They can also help identify practices to try different ways to exploit and enhance opportunities.\n2.8.6 INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER PERFORMANCE DOMAINS\nThe Uncertainty Performance Domain interacts with the Planning, Project Work, Delivery, and Measurement Performance Domains from the product or deliverable perspective. As planning is conducted, activities to reduce uncertainty and risks can be built into the plans. These are carried out in the Delivery Performance Domain. Measurements can indicate if the risk level is changing over time.\nProject team members and other stakeholders are the main sources of information regarding uncertainty. They can provide information, suggestions, and assistance in working with all the various forms of uncertainty.\nThe choice of life cycle and development approach impact how uncertainty will be addressed. On a predictive project where the scope is relatively stable, reserve in the schedule and budget can be used to respond to risks. On a project using an adaptive approach where the requirements are likely to evolve and where there may be ambiguity around how systems will interact or how stakeholders will react, the project team can adjust plans to reflect evolving understanding or use reserves to offset the impacts of realized risks.\n2.8.7 CHECKING RESULTS\nTable 2-10 identifies the outcomes on the left and ways of checking them on the right."
