It is a structured project management method that uses the experience gained from thousands of projects, as well as contributions from countless project sponsors, project managers, project teams, academics, trainers, and consultants.\nPRINCE2 has been designed to be adaptable so that it can be applied to any project, regardless of the project’s purpose, scale, type, organization, geography, or culture. This is achieved by:\n● separating the management of the project from the specialist development activities, such as design or construction, allowing any specialist activities to be integrated into a controlled environment for the project\n● focusing on what needs to be done to manage the project, rather than prescribing how work is done\n● requiring that the method is established specifically for the needs and context of the project by the way it is applied and tailored."

      "content": "PRINCE2 is a project management method composed of five integrated elements: principles, people, practices, processes, and the project context (figure 1.1).\nFigure 1.1 The five integrated elements of PRINCE2\nThe structure of this book is based on these five integrated elements:\n● PRINCE2 principles The principles are the guiding obligations that determine whether the project is genuinely being managed using PRINCE2. There are seven principles, and unless all of them are applied, it is not a PRINCE2 project. The PRINCE2 principles are explained in Chapter 2.\n● People Projects need people, mainly those working on the project and those affected by the project. An understanding of the needs, capabilities, and motivations of the people involved and the relationships between them is crucial to how the project is established and managed. How people are put at the centre of the method is described in Chapter 3.\n● PRINCE2 practices The practices describe essential aspects of project management that must be applied consistently and throughout the project lifecycle. The seven practices explain the specific treatment required of that aspect of project management for the PRINCE2 processes to be effective and why they are necessary. The PRINCE2 practices are covered in Chapters 4 to 11.\n● PRINCE2 processes The seven processes describe the entire project lifecycle, from activities before getting started, through the stages of project delivery, and to the final act of project closure. Each process has checklists of recommended activities and related responsibilities. The PRINCE2 processes are provided in Chapters 12 to 19.\n● The project context The principles, practices, and processes are applied by the people involved to ensure that the method is fit for the project context. How PRINCE2 can be applied to common contexts is outlined in section 1.4.\nAppendix A provides a summary of management products (such as the business case) used in the practices and processes. Appendix B provides a summary of PRINCE2 roles. The glossary summarizes the PRINCE2 defined terms that are used throughout the official book. Throughout this official book, we refer to the organization that commissions the project as the ‘business’."

      "content": "Key message\nThe five integrated elements of the PRINCE2 method are designed to work together. The practices ensure that the principles are continually applied during the processes in a way that is specific to the project context and consider the relationships and requirements of people within the project team and those outside the project team.\nA key challenge that organizations face is balancing two competing needs, which are:\n● maintaining current business operations, also known as business as usual (such as maintaining profitability, service quality, customer relationships, brand loyalty, productivity, and market confidence)\n● improving or transforming business operations to survive and compete in the future, also known as business change (for example, anticipating and deciding how change can be introduced to the greatest effect).\nAs the pace of change accelerates (whether technological, business, social, or regulatory), and the need to adapt becomes more evident, the focus of management attention is inevitably moving to achieve a balance between business as usual and business change. Projects are a means by which we introduce change, and although many of the skills required are the same, there are some crucial differences between managing business as usual and managing project work.\nDefinition: Project\nA temporary organization that is created for the purpose of delivering one or more business products according to an agreed business case.\nThere are five characteristics of a project that distinguish it from business as usual:\n● Change Projects are the means by which we introduce change.\n● Temporary Projects are temporary in nature. When the desired change has been implemented, business as usual resumes (in its new form), and the need for the project is removed. As projects are temporary, they should therefore have a defined start and a defined end.\n● Cross-functional A project involves a team of people with different skills working together on a temporary basis to introduce a change that will impact others outside the team. Projects often work across the usual functional divisions within an organization and sometimes span different organizations. This frequently causes stresses and strains both within and between organizations (for example, between customers and suppliers). Each has a different perspective and motivation for getting involved in the project.\n● Unique Every project is unique. An organization may undertake many similar projects and establish a familiar, proven pattern of project activity, but each one will differ in a certain way. This can mean a different team, customer, supplier, product, location, or timeframe. All these factors combine to make every project unique.\n● Uncertainty The characteristics already listed will introduce threats and opportunities over and above those typically encountered within business as usual. Projects are riskier than any operational aspects of an organization.\nProjects vary greatly. For example, an organization might undertake an IT project to improve the systems required to manage its business. Another organization might undertake a clinical research project to bring a new drug to market, and another organization might be building a new facility. Furthermore, the environment within which the project is being managed may influence how it is started, delivered, assured, and closed. There may be factors external to the project itself, such as organizational standards, the maturity of the organization, and regulatory frameworks and factors specific to the individual project, such as the industry sector and the geographical locations. PRINCE2 is designed to work for all types of projects in any project environment."

      "content": "Definition: Project management\nProject management is the application of methods, tools, techniques, and competencies to enable the project to meet its objectives.\nThe five characteristics of a project (1.3) can result in some typical challenges such as:\n● ambiguity regarding who is responsible for what aspects of the project, leading to confusion and a lack of accountability\n● ambiguity or conflict regarding what the project will deliver, costs, and when\n● unrealistic expectations regarding what the project will deliver, costs, and when\n● unavailability of resources or reassigning resources to business as usual activities over project work\n● difficulty in estimating effort, durations, and costs for project work\n● uncontrolled change (sometimes referred to as scope creep)\n● difficulty keeping the project management team and stakeholders informed, engaged, and motivated during the project lifecycle.\nThe purpose of project management is to address these challenges by reducing and managing ambiguity. This is achieved by uniting the involved parties to clarify objectives and working practices. The aim is to control the specialist work needed to create the products required of the project. Project management involves the planning, delegating, monitoring, and control of all aspects of the project and the motivation of those involved to achieve the project objectives within expected performance targets."

      "content": "Definition: Performance target\nThe project’s performance target sets the expected success level against which the management of the project will be judged. PRINCE2 includes performance targets for benefits, cost, time, quality, scope, sustainability, and risk.\nPRINCE2 includes seven aspects of project performance to be managed. These are:\n● Benefits Those involved in the project need to be able to answer the question: why are we doing this, and who are we doing it for? The project management team must have a clear understanding of the purpose of the project and what needs to be achieved to justify its investment.\n● Costs As the project develops, there will be many factors that can affect the cost budget available or that may lead to (potential) underspend or overspend against the cost budget. The project has to be affordable.\n● Time When will the project start, when will the key products be delivered, and when will the project finish?\n● Quality Finishing on time and within budget is not much consolation if the result of the project is not as specified or does not work. What is delivered by the project must be fit for purpose.\n● Scope What will the project deliver? There must be agreement on the project’s scope, otherwise the various parties involved may make different assumptions about what is included or excluded. The project management team should not deliver beyond the scope, as this is a common source of delays, overspend, and uncontrolled change (sometimes referred to as scope creep).\n● Sustainability All projects have an impact on their environment, and project management teams need to know the sustainability performance targets for the project work and for the products required of the project.\n● Risk All projects involve risk. But exactly how much risk is the business prepared to take? Without a shared understanding of the business’ risk appetite, the project management team may be too risk-averse or take more risks than the business is prepared to accept.\nPriorities can be established by agreeing on the project’s performance targets. For example, an urgent project may place more importance on time than on other performance targets, such as costs. PRINCE2 helps with setting such priorities by allowing a range to be specified for each performance target in the form of tolerances (see section 2.4). Some performance targets may have a narrow tolerance, yet others may have a broader tolerance. The agreement of performance targets and their tolerances is a prerequisite for exploring options and determining the project approach.\nAll seven project performance targets and their tolerances are used throughout the PRINCE2 method as the basis for control.\nPRINCE2 has been designed so it can work within any context including organizational and commercial context, delivery method, sustainability requirements, and project scale. These common contexts are described throughout this book to illustrate how PRINCE2 can be applied or tailored."

The organization delivering the project (the supplier) will do so to satisfy a particular need identified by the business (the customer).\nThe business may divide the work into one or more elements, some of which may require suppliers to deliver. Other elements may be delivered by the business itself, for example, an internal department such as IT or facilities. For a supplier, the work to be delivered could be the subject of a legally binding contract, resulting from the procurement process. To deliver this work, the supplier might procure subcontractors itself, further dividing its work into additional elements.\nIn a commercial environment, there may be hierarchies of commercial relationships between suppliers. Rather than a simple customer-supplier relationship involving two organizations, projects might involve multiple organizations covered by multiple contracts. There may be a single customer with a prime contractor, or there may be several customers and several supplier organizations, each of which may have its own business reasons for undertaking the project.\nThe contract between the parties describes how the customer(s) and supplier(s) will collaborate to deliver the project. The rights and duties covered by the agreement will need to be reflected in how the project is managed.\nIn this book, the term ‘customer’ is only used where there is a commercial relationship between the business and the supplier."

Typical delivery methods include:\n● Linear-sequential approach Each of the delivery steps to create the products occurs in sequence, and the product is made available during or at the end of the project (for example, in a construction project where requirements gathering and design occur before construction starts).\n● Iterative-incremental approach This approach is often, but not exclusively, used for product development, where requirements gathering, design, development and/or coding, and testing occur iteratively throughout the lifecycle of the project. This approach is often referred to as an agile approach.\n● Hybrid approach Some elements of the project use a linear-sequential approach, and other elements use an iterative-incremental approach. For example, a linear-sequential approach can be used for the development of the infrastructure for a service. Then, an iterative-incremental approach can be used for the development of the customer service portal for users to access the service.\nPRINCE2 provides the controlled environment for specialist delivery methods. It does not assume or require any specific delivery method. Any approach can be used through the separation of the management of the project and specialist work to produce the project products. Detailed and complementary guidance on working on iterative-incremental projects using PRINCE2 can be found in the PRINCE2 Agile official book."

It is usually more helpful to think of projects in terms of simple rather than small and complex rather than large. Generally, it is a case of how the business perceives the risk and the importance of the project, relative to its business as usual operations.\nPRINCE2 can be tailored to the scale of the project via the:\n● governance arrangements between the business layer, the project board, the project manager, and the teams\n● choice of which project roles are appointed to individuals from the user, business, and supplier organizations (for example, combining roles in simple projects and dividing roles in complex projects)\n● formality and level of detail of project documentation (in PRINCE2 these are referred to as management products)\n● formality of the project controls (for example, frequency of reporting and reviewing)\n● selection and integration of the management approaches, such as a commercial management or change management approach\n● number of stages and work packages the project is divided into\n● setting of the project performance targets and their tolerances."

A short summary of each scenario is provided below. Some of the scenarios feature projects at an early stage in their development, whereas others are partway through the project lifecycle. The following icons represent each of the scenarios that appear throughout the guide.\nScenario 1: Data Knowledge\nData Knowledge is a company with the mission of leveraging the power of big data through advanced data analytics solutions. By analysing the wants, needs, desires, and frustrations of social media users, Data Knowledge can transform raw and unstructured data into reliable predictions that enable organizations to utilize consumer behaviours and insights.\nHowever, they have not been as effective in using data to their own advantage, now that the company has over 300 staff. In fact, the head of the data science division raised concerns in the last senior leadership team meeting. The concerns were regarding the lack of visibility of who is working on what projects, poor capacity planning, and claims of an overworked team with low morale due to the constant juggling of commitments and firefighting issues.\nAs a way of addressing this, the data science division has been authorized to start a project to develop a time-recording solution and a set of reports on project and task assignments along with resource utilization and capacity planning. The reports are expected to offer interactive and real-time insights that can enable data-driven decisions around the utilization and planning of resources.\nData Knowledge has a defined framework for the management of projects. This is expected to be a simple business change project, taking no more than three months in the current financial year to complete.\nSince Data Knowledge has in-house data analysis and app development capabilities as well as clear requirements for this project, the project will be led by the head of data science. They will work with the development division in an iterative and incremental approach. This is to ensure that the solution can be deployed quickly to several new projects and enhanced during its roll-out to the rest of the business.\nThe high-level project plan is as follows:\nStage 1 (initiation)\n● product backlog\n● minimum viable product definition\nStage 2\n● timebox 1\n● prototype of time-recording application\n● mock-up of resource management reports\n● timebox 2\n● first release of time-recording application and reports (must-have features)\n● pilot\n● timebox 3\n● enhancements following pilot\n● timebox 4\n● demonstration\n● roll-out\nStage 3\n● product backlog (following roll-out)\n● closure.\nThe main output from the project is to be a time-recording application and set of resource management reports available to all business units.\nScenario 2: Louistown City Council\nLouistown is a historical town which is home to over 40,000 residents and attracts over 20,000 visitors per year. The city council has been criticized for the lack of investment and modernization of the town centre.\nThey have recently decided to improve the vibrancy of the area and offer increased opportunities for business by approving the funds for the ‘Louistown is Open for Business’ (LOB) portfolio. This is an ambitious portfolio of projects covering the next five-year plan cycle.\nA new shopping centre, provisionally named ‘LouisShopping’, is seen as a key project within this portfolio. This is a complex infrastructure project due to the:\n● location of the building and historical nature of the surrounding buildings\n● requirement for the design to be consistent with the environment while offering modern facilities supported by the latest technology\n● need to include underground parking space\n● importance of minimizing disruption to residents and businesses during the construction works\n● recent award of ‘green town’ status to Louistown, and the sustainability requirements this will impose on the development.\nDue to the nature of the work, in which just the construction element is likely to span over two financial years, the council has approved the strategic business case, the initial high-level project plan and has appointed BuildyBrick as the main contractor. They have established a requirement for a traditional delivery method in line with their standard approach to projects. The general view is that this project is long overdue, and the council would like ‘LouisShopping’ to be open to the public by the end of financial year three.\nThe project has just completed the initiation stage and commenced the first delivery stage (stage 2). The high-level project plan is as follows:\nStage 1 (initiation)\n● strategic business case and high-level project plan approval\n● appoint contractor\nStage 2\n● design\nStage 3\n● site preparation\n● utilities and systems\n● construction\nStage 4\n● testing\n● inspections\nStage 5\n● demobilization.\nThe main output from the project is a shopping centre constructed and ready to open to the public.\nScenario 3: Findef\nFindef was formed eight years ago with the promise to revolutionize how businesses identify fraudsters, to protect the reputation of businesses, and to minimize financial risks. The company experienced substantial growth in the first few years, transforming from a niche small-medium-enterprise (SME) to one of the leading fintech firms in the field of financial fraud, working with the world’s largest banks and merchants. In the last 18 months, Findef’s growth has stagnated. This factor, coupled with the arrival of new competitors, is creating discomfort among some investors.\nIn response, the leadership board recently approved the development of a suite of three innovative cybersecurity products that will transform the market in financial risk management. Additionally, the leadership board agreed that Findef will change its commercial and operating models to exploit the new products to their full potential. The company will now deal directly with the end user rather than through banks and merchants.\nThe FindefTwo programme has been established to oversee both the business transformation and the development of the new products. As the programme requires fresh investment, the board has established an investment committee that funds and oversees the programme.\nThe project for the product development will use a hybrid approach of linear-sequential for the overarching design and deployment of the product set and iterative-incremental for the development of each product. The project also includes upskilling Findef’s DevOps team in a new development platform. To mitigate some risks, the project includes procuring advisors and a marketing agency that could validate assumptions and share their product experience with the company.\nThe project is at the beginning of stage 3. The high-level project plan for the product development project is as follows:\nStage 1 (initiation)\n● business case, project initiation documentation\nStage 2 (high-level design)\n● request for proposals (advisor, marketing agency, training), contract awards\n● product design (product family architecture)\nStage 3 (detailed design)\n● product design: product 1\n● early market testing\n● DevOps upskilling\nStage 4 (MVP product 1)\n● iterative-incremental development and soft launch of product 1 to minimum viable product (MVP)\n● product design: product 2, product design: product 3\nStage 5 (MVP products 2 and 3)\n● product 1 ready for full launch\n● iterative-incremental development and soft launch of products 2 and 3 to minimum viable products (MVP)\nStage 6 (first launch)\n● transfer product 1 to BAU support\n● product 2 ready for full launch, product 3 ready for full launch\nStage 7 (second launch)\n● transfer product 2 to BAU support, transfer product 3 to BAU support\n● closure.\nThe main output from the project will be three products ready for full launch and transferred to BAU for operations and maintenance.\nScenario 4: NowByou\nNowByou is a not-for-profit organization that works with local communities to eliminate discrimination of any kind and help advance the international human rights system through local and targeted interventions.\nNowByou forms, chairs, and equips networking and support groups, where anyone who has experienced discrimination can share their experiences and thoughts in a safe and empowering space. Additionally, NowByou is one of the few non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the country that works directly with police forces to co-develop campaigns that encourage the reporting of discriminatory incidents to authorities.\nRecent research has shown that discrimination against marginalized groups, particularly the homeless and refugees, is growing at a concerning rate. The increase in discrimination has led NowByou to believe that a new six-month campaign is required to address this issue.\nThey have decided to run the campaign as a project, aiming to both raise awareness of this type of discrimination and reinforce their own brand recognition (as NowByou is highly dependent on the goodwill of donors and financial aid from partners).\nThe project management maturity of the organization is very low, with no standardized processes or templates in place. For that reason, NowByou has contacted a professional project manager with a track record of successful delivery in the not-for-profit sector who will be responsible for:\n● developing the initial project management documentation\n● advising and coaching the NowByou director of campaigns, who is sponsoring the project\n● mentoring the staff member who will be appointed as project manager\n● advise the project team how to use a variety of media (tv, press, and social networks) for this, and other future projects.\nThere is a high-level view of the project, but this is to be confirmed, as pre-project discussions are still occurring:\nStage 1 (initiation)\n● business case\n● project initiation documentation\nStage 2\n● campaign high-level requirements gathering\n● options analysis\nStage 3\n● implementation of chosen option(s)\n● closure.\nThe main output from the project will be a delivered multi-channel campaign."

These principles enable the project management team to decide how PRINCE2 will be used on their project.\nThe seven PRINCE2 principles are:\n● ensure continued business justification\n● learn from experience\n● define roles, responsibilities, and relationships\n● manage by stages\n● manage by exception\n● focus on products\n● tailor to suit the project.\nHow the method is applied and tailored depends on the nature of the project and factors internal and external to the business as shown in figure 2.1."

So long as the principles are followed, PRINCE2 is being used effectively.\nKey message\nA PRINCE2 project has business justification sufficient to warrant investment to initiate the project and ongoing investment through to successful completion. If it does not, it should be stopped.\nThere must be a justifiable reason for starting a project, and the justification must remain valid and be revalidated throughout the lifecycle of the project. The business justification drives decision-making to ensure the project remains aligned with the benefits sought and contributes to business objectives.\nOrganizations that lack rigour in business justification may find that projects proceed even when there are few real benefits or when a project has only tentative associations with the business strategy. Poor alignment with business strategy can also result in organizations having a portfolio of projects that have inconsistent or duplicated objectives."

      "content": "Compulsory projects, such as those driven by legislation or regulation, still require justification for the chosen approach to ensure it represents the best value for money. All parties involved in the project will need a balance between expected benefits, costs, and risks for them to have business justification for their involvement.\nThe business justification for a project may change; therefore, it is important that what the project is delivering remains consistent with the evolving justification. If continuing with the project can no longer be justified, then it should be stopped and end in a controlled way. Cancelling a project in these circumstances is a positive contribution to the business as the project’s funds and resources can be reinvested in other more worthwhile projects.\nAfter the project is completed, the project should be reviewed to evaluate if the benefits have materialized sufficiently to warrant the final investment and what lessons can be learned from the project.\nBelow are some examples of the application of the ‘ensure business justification’ principle.\nFor a commercial project with one or more customers and suppliers, each party will need to have a clear business justification to undertake the project and to continue with it. The customer may want to enhance market share by introducing a new product. The supplier’s business justification might include non-financial benefits, such as gaining an impressive customer reference for promotional purposes or building experience in applying new technologies.\nFor a co-owned project, such as a governmental project to jointly develop a new IT system across a number of agencies, if the business justification is lost for one or more parties, those parties should consider ending their participation in the project. In this case, the consequences of ending or withdrawing participation in the project, such as contractual obligations, will inform the decision and any approach to prematurely close the project. Throughout the project, each investing party will need to keep monitoring their own business justification to ensure that the project is still worthwhile for them.\nKey message\nA PRINCE2 project team actively seeks, records, and implements improvements as a result of relevant lessons learned from prior projects and throughout the life of the project. It applies them in future projects and shares them for others to apply.\nA common characteristic of projects is that they include an element of uniqueness. This makes projects challenging as the temporary team may not have experience of a project quite like the one being undertaken.\nTo overcome these challenges, project teams need to find ways to learn from the experience of others and from the experience gained from the project as it develops.\nLearning from experience occurs throughout the lifecycle of the project:\n● When starting a project Previous or similar projects should be reviewed to see if lessons could be applied. If the project is a ‘first’ for the people within the business or if there is any content which is new or novel, then it is even more important to learn from others. This could include projects delivered by people or organizations external to the business to identify relevant lessons.\n● As the project progresses The project team should continue to learn. Lessons should be included in relevant reports and reviews and included at the end of each stage. The goal is to seek opportunities to implement improvements during the life of the project. The retrospective technique is an example of gathering lessons in agile approach.\n● As the project closes The project team should share the insights gained during the project.\nThe foundation for learning is data and the ability to gain insights from it. Projects should be clear about what data is required, how it will be analysed so that insights can be gained and applied, and what will happen to the data during the project and when the project closes.\nProject teams need to consider how to effectively share lessons with all those involved in the project, as people may have different learning needs and preferences. Some may learn best by observing, whereas others do so by experimenting.\nIt is important to learn from both mistakes and successes to continuously improve and innovate. It is the responsibility of everyone involved with the project to identify lessons rather than wait for someone else to do so. Lessons that are not used to improve the project, or future projects, are only ‘lessons identified’ and not actually ‘lessons learned’.\nBelow are some examples of applying the ‘learn from experience’ principle.\nIn a smaller project with one co-located team, ‘lessons learned’ can be discussed on a regular basis in team meetings. Learning in this case happens on the job, potentially on a daily basis.\nIn a large and complex project, the learning process will involve many project team members who could be spread across multiple teams and locations. This large-scale approach will make it harder to ensure everyone has access to the same learning experience.\nLearning in larger projects may require more advanced communication, such as explanatory videos, presentation kits for project team managers, or tailored workshops in subgroups. Such projects may benefit from field trips, pilots, simulations, or go-live rehearsals as a source of learning too."

      "content": "Key message\nA PRINCE2 project has defined and agreed roles and responsibilities within an organization structure that engages the business, user, and supplier stakeholder interests. Moreover, a PRINCE2 project management team initiates and builds relationships with and between internal and external stakeholders.\nProjects need people. It is important that the right people are involved, and they know what is expected of them and what they may expect from others in the project. Successful projects require an understanding of the relationships with and between stakeholders and ongoing activities to strengthen them. This is why ‘People’ is one of the five integrated elements of PRINCE2.\nStakeholders can be individuals or groups within or external to the business. Stakeholders within the business could be a work council, sustainability board, diversity board, owners, department leaders, or other project teams; stakeholders outside the business could be trade unions, customers, suppliers, communities, interest groups, banks, or the media.\nAll projects have the following primary stakeholders: the business, users, and suppliers (see section 1.5.1). All three stakeholder interests need to be represented effectively in the project management team; this is reflected in the design of a PRINCE2 project board (see section 6.2.1).\nDefining roles and responsibilities is particularly challenging as projects are cross-functional, may involve more than one organization, often have a mix of full and part-time resources, and may be spread across multiple locations. The management structures of the parties involved in the project are likely to be varied, with different priorities, objectives, and interests to protect. The day-to-day line management structures of the business may not be designed for, or suited to, project work.\nThe assignment of roles to individuals throughout the life of the project and their responsibilities must be clear, unambiguous, and accepted. To be successful, projects must have an explicit project management team structure consisting of defined and agreed roles and responsibilities for the people involved in the project. Moreover, the projects must have an understanding of the relationships and a means for effective communication between them.\nThe goal is to clearly articulate roles and responsibilities to provide a clear, coherent structure that all stakeholders understand and is suitable to enable effective project delivery performance against the project performance targets.\nBelow are some examples of applying the ‘define roles, responsibilities, and relationships’ principle.\nIf the project is part of a programme, then some of the project responsibilities may be held by people in the programme management team. In this case, the programme’s business change manager (BCM) may undertake the project executive or senior user role on the project board to help align the project with the programme. The programme management office (PMO) could provide project support, or the programme’s design authority could be given decision-making responsibility for authorizing changes at the project level. Agreements need to be made about who accepts which project role and the authority and responsibility they each have. The goal is to enhance consistency and coherence between the project and the programme.\nThe nature of the project will determine the number of stakeholders and the amount of change it creates for each of them. A project with a small number of stakeholders and a high degree of impact will have a very focused approach to engaging with them, perhaps on an individual and personal basis. A project with a large number of stakeholders and a wide range of impacts may have to use multiple approaches with a mix of personalized engagement and more general engagement through surveys and broadcast channels (such as emails).\nFor projects that have development teams using agile development methods, the PRINCE2 team manager role may be held collectively by the development team."

      "content": "Key message\nA PRINCE2 project establishes limits of delegated authority by defining tolerances for performance against its plans.\nDefinition: Tolerance\nThe permissible deviation above and below the plan’s target for benefits, cost, time, quality, scope, sustainability, and risk without needing to escalate the deviation to the next level of management. Tolerance is applied at project, stage, and team levels.\nPRINCE2 enables appropriate governance by defining distinct responsibilities for directing, managing, and delivering the project and clearly defining accountability at each level.\nAccountability is established by:\n● delegating authority from one management level to the next by setting tolerances against the seven aspects of performance (benefits, cost, time, quality, scope, sustainability, and risk) for the respective level (project, stage, team)\n● establishing controls so if tolerances are forecast to be exceeded, they are flagged as being an exception and immediately escalated to the next management level for a decision on how to proceed\n● establishing an assurance mechanism so that each management level can be confident that the exception controls are effective.\nThe seven aspects of a plan’s performance requiring tolerances to be defined are:\n● Benefits The degree to which it is permissible to underdeliver or overdeliver benefits; for example, the business case for a sales improvement project modelled with a plus or minus two percent range of increased income generation.\n● Costs The degree of permissible overspend or underspend against an agreed budget (both personhours and financial).\n● Time The degree to which it is permitted to deliver earlier or later than an agreed target completion date compared to the project plan, stage plan, or work package description.\n● Quality How much something can vary from agreed acceptance criteria; for example, a project to produce a new sports watch might have a target that the watch should work underwater to a depth of 50 metres with a permissible tolerance of plus or minus five metres.\n● Scope Permissible variation of the plan’s products; for example, a project requiring delivery of all the must-have mandatory requirements but permitted to deliver only 60 percent or more of its shouldhave and could-have requirements.\n● Sustainability The degree to which the project product or project activities required to deliver the project can vary from sustainability targets; for example, a new production line that operates within five percent of an emissions target and was delivered using around 70 percent of workforce coming from the local community.\n● Risk Limits on the plan’s aggregated risks; for example, a tolerance that the cost of aggregated threats must remain less than 10 percent of the agreed budget and that the cost of any single threat must be no more than five percent of the budget.\nThe implementation of ‘manage by exception’ provides for efficient use of senior management time as it reduces senior managers’ time burden without removing their control. This ensures that decisions are made at the right level in the organization. The goal is to alert the next management level in the project as early as possible that the work will move outside of agreed tolerances, and a decision is needed on if and how to proceed. The decision-maker can decide to accept the deviation and its consequences or act to remove or reduce it.\nA project using an iterative-incremental delivery method with defined timeboxes will typically fix time and cost and vary in scope. In this case, time and cost will have much tighter tolerances set than the scope.\nAn example of applying the ‘manage by exception’ principle is that the use of tolerances will differ depending on the project’s context, such as a project with a commercial arrangement between customer and supplier where the tolerances will be reflected in the contract. In this example, if the project manager learns that procured materials will be delivered late and the issue cannot be resolved within the tolerances, the project manager will need to alert the project board quickly. The contract may define any cost remedies available between the customer and supplier, but there may be consequences for the project’s stakeholders caused by the delay. In this case, the project board will need to decide what actions to take and provide direction to the project manager. By reviewing the tolerances at the end of every stage, the project is able to adapt and modify the next stage activities to reflect a changing operating environment."

      "content": "Key message\nA PRINCE2 project is planned, monitored, and controlled on a stage-by-stage basis.\nDefinition: Stage\nThe section of a project that the project manager is managing on behalf of the project board at any one time.\nThe focus on managing by stages ensures that the project is properly initiated before work starts on delivery of the project’s outputs. Every PRINCE2 project should have at least two stages: an initiation stage and one further stage. Many projects benefit from having more than two stages.\nAdvantages of managing by stages are:\n● It enables adaptability to changes in the project or business context.\n● It provides review and decision points, giving the project board opportunities to assess the project’s viability at defined intervals rather than let it continue in an uncontrolled manner.\n● It provides the ability to ensure that key decisions are made prior to the detailed work needed to implement them.\n● It allows clarification of what the impact will be of an identified external influence, such as the organizational budget setting process or the finalizing of legislation.\n● It facilitates the principle of manage by exception by delegating authority to the project manager at each stage.\nThe choice of appropriate stages for a project will depend on a number of factors (see 7.2.3), including:\n● minimizing risk exposure through the project lifecycle\n● the size and complexity of the project (shorter stages offer more control, whereas longer stages reduce the effort for senior management)\n● any significant decisions and control points required during the project’s lifecycle; these will often be linked to key investment, business, or technical decisions\n● sector or business policies and standards.\nThe project board authorizes one stage of the project at a time and delegates the authority for day-to day control of the stage, within agreed tolerances, to the project manager. As long as the stage is forecast to remain within tolerance, the project manager is authorized to make adjustments as required. The project board only authorizes the next stage if there is sufficient business justification and funds to continue. If the project no longer has a valid business case, the project board will determine whether and how to recover the project or prematurely end it.\nAn example of applying the ‘manage by stages’ principle is when teams work in ‘sprints’ or ‘timeboxes’ while operating incrementally and iteratively to realize the agreed features and user stories. PRINCE2 can be tailored to work with sprints and user stories instead of work packages and product descriptions. The project manager will define how many sprints are required for each stage. In this way, the project is consistent with the principle of manage by stages."

PRINCE2 includes four types of products:\n● Management products Are often documents or information needed to support the management of the project, such as a business case or a plan.\n● Specialist products Are the products that are needed by the user to realize the benefits required of the project.\n● The project product Describes the total output from the project as defined in the project product description (see section 7.3.2.1).\n● External products Are products developed or provided outside of the project’s control but which the project is dependent on, for example, the publication of a new standard.\nSpecialist products will be referred to throughout the book as simply ‘products’, except when a distinction is needed between management and specialist products.\nThe term ‘project products’ refers to the specialist and management products created during the project.\nProjects that focus on what the project needs to produce are more likely to be efficient and avoid waste than projects that focus primarily on the work activity. This is because the purpose of a project is to fulfil stakeholder expectations in accordance with the business justification. Therefore, there must be a common understanding of the products required and the user quality expectations for them.\nThe purpose of a project can be interpreted in many different ways, unless there is an explicit understanding of the products to be produced and the criteria against which they will be individually approved. PRINCE2 requires projects to be output-oriented rather than work-oriented. PRINCE2 calls these outputs ‘products’.\nThis focus on products:\n● ensures that the project only performs work that directly contributes to the delivery of a product (that is, the project does no more work than it needs to deliver its agreed products)\n● helps manage uncontrolled change (‘scope creep’) by ensuring that all changes are agreed in terms of how they will impact the project products and the business case for the project\n● reduces the risk of user dissatisfaction and acceptance disputes by agreeing (at the start of the project) what will be produced by the project\n● assists a pause or closure of the project. Agreement can be more easily met to pause or close a project after certain products are completed. It also allows easier and controlled resumption of the project.\nAn output-oriented project is one that agrees and defines the project product prior to undertaking the activities required to produce it. The set of agreed products defines the scope of a project and provides the basis for planning and control.\nA PRINCE2 project uses product descriptions that provide the means to determine effort estimates, resource requirements, dependencies, and activity schedules. The focus on products supports almost every aspect of PRINCE2: planning, responsibilities, progress reporting, quality, change control, acceptance, and risk management.\nBelow are examples of applying the ‘focus on products’ principle.\nIn a small simple project, such as publishing a new management book, a single project product description might suffice. This description will determine, among others features, how many chapters will be required, the desired total number of pages, the language, and the number of graphics in colour versus black and white. Product descriptions for projects using an iterative-incremental delivery method, such as agile, may be in the form of requirements, features, epics, and user stories.\nFor larger and more complex projects, the project product description will be divided into sub-products and then further subdivided to a level of detail to understand how each product will be sourced, developed, and approved. The further the products are subdivided, the harder it will be for the project board to be able to decide whether product descriptions are correct. This is because the content becomes more technical and will require specialist knowledge to understand. In this case, it is important that the supplier has the expertise to define the right products at each level, and the business establishes project assurance with the knowledge necessary to assure that the product meets the specification."

Furthermore, it can be used for any project type, geography, or culture. It can be used on any project because the method is designed to be applied and tailored to suit each project’s specific needs and context.\nThe purpose of tailoring is to ensure that:\n● the project management method used is appropriate to the project (for example, aligning the method with the business processes that may govern and support the project, such as human resources, finance, and procurement)\n● project controls are appropriate to the project’s scale, complexity, importance, delivery method, team capability, and risk (for example, the frequency and formality of reports and reviews).\nTailoring requires the project board and the project manager to make proactive choices and decisions on how PRINCE2 will be applied. It may also involve adjusting the terminology to match terms used by the organizations involved or replacing some of the PRINCE2 techniques (such as the risk management technique) with alternative procedures such as those already used by the business or supplier(s).\nWhen tailoring PRINCE2, it is important to remember that effective project management requires information (but not necessarily documents) and decisions (but not necessarily meetings).\nIf PRINCE2 is not tailored, it is unlikely that the project management effort and management approaches would be appropriate for the needs of the project. This can lead to inattentive project management at one extreme, where PRINCE2 is followed without question, or ‘heroic’ project management at the other extreme, where PRINCE2 is not really followed at all.\nThe project manager is responsible for tailoring and will make recommendations having consulted relevant lessons and standards. The project board is accountable and needs to approve the recommendations at the end of the initiation stage and every time there is a proposed change to the management approaches.\nHow PRINCE2 will be applied and tailored for the particular project is captured in the project initiation documentation. This ensures that all those involved in the project understand how PRINCE2 is to be used and how to carry out their responsibilities. Care should be taken that the proposed tailoring is consistent with PRINCE2’s seven principles and that the resultant method retains its integrity.\nAn example of applying the ‘tailor to the suit the project’ principle is where the project has a commercial customer-supplier relationship. The project may need to align the project management processes, practices, and documentation to two or more quality systems, one from the customer and one from the supplier. For example, a supplier may wish to use their in-house product development framework based on an iterative-incremental delivery method using agile management approaches. To avoid potential confusion, the project manager might propose to:\n● map and define terminology between PRINCE2 and the supplier’s agile management approaches\n● add the project team roles of ‘customer subject matter expert’ and ‘supplier subject matter expert’ to the agile team, representing the customer and the supplier respectively\n● add a coach to guide the teams in working effectively in the combination of PRINCE2 and the supplier’s in-house agile method\n● collaborate and communicate according to agile ways of working, such as a daily stand-up and support agile reporting tools, such as information radiators\n● define project procedures, such as working with sprints or work packages, product descriptions, or user stories, and how to use these in the project."

For example, for some projects the majority of the users may sit in the organizational ecosystem. For some projects all the suppliers could fall within the project ecosystem as they are uniquely engaged for the specific project and have no other relationships with the business. Understanding where the business, supplier and user interests sit in each of the ecosystems helps in deciding how they will be represented on the project and how they will be engaged.\nProjects often combine people from different parts of the organizational ecosystem, where different working cultures may exist. A project team may need to establish a project culture that is distinct from the business but in such a way that it remains aligned with the wider organizational ecosystem.\nDefinition: Culture\nCulture is the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and ways of working that characterize a group of people.\nA shared understanding of the project developed with key influencers must be captured as part of the project brief. This shared understanding of the project combines with an understanding of the external legal and regulatory obligations and relevant business commitments (such as sustainability targets) to provide a guide for multi-layered decision-making.\nBased on the shared understanding developed with the key influencers, it is possible to establish ways of working to ensure all impacted areas of the organizational ecosystem are appropriately involved in the project as it progresses. The ways of working are captured in the management approaches for the project. Gaining a shared understanding is also enabled through who is assigned to project roles (see Chapter 6), including decision-makers on the project board who represent business, user, and supplier interests.\nThe project management team structure and the quality and planning practices in PRINCE2 ensure that users are represented or involved in defining, developing, quality control of products, and consulted in the decision-making process.\nThe shared understanding enables aligned behaviours and sets the culture for the project.\nAt the start of a project, the project culture tends to reflect the organization’s culture. However, a distinct project culture may emerge as it evolves. It is important that the formal ways of working evolve to reflect the emerging project culture and support alignment with the wider organizational ecosystem that the project needs to interact with.\nAs the project progresses, key influencers on a project may change, as do the key relationships. It is important to ensure that the shared understanding of the project remains valid and supports the project’s evolving culture. Project teams should check the shared understanding at the end of each stage of the project and whenever there is a change in key influencers.\nDefined ways of working should remain aligned with how people are actually working. Persistent non-compliance with project processes is often a leading indicator that the agreed ways of working have become unaligned with the emerging project culture. Although it is tempting to assume that non-compliance is because of poor behaviours, there could be an underlying disconnect that is worth exploring. The ways of working should evolve to remain aligned with the desired project culture and with the wider organizational ecosystem which the project interacts with.\nScenario: embedding shared understanding/users inside and outside organization (NowByou example: professional PM used community of practice ('project club') and gradually introduced practices/terminology, adapting to existing culture.)"

On projects, this is best done through collaboration across the project ecosystem, persuading, influencing, and co-creating with a focus on managing key relationships and seeking regular feedback to ensure team members remain aligned to the project’s objectives and agree to joint ways of working.\nManagement Instructing the execution of tasks in line with agreed ways of working. Co-creating ways of working with project team members (and stakeholders) significantly improves people’s willingness to be managed in line with them.\nProjects are delivered by people in a temporary team, typically working across organizational boundaries. As a result, the people assigned to work on projects often have multiple reporting lines. This reporting line can be to a part of the organization that has allocated the person to the project for a limited duration. This can also be to a supplier’s organization where external people provide project skills and capabilities. Sometimes people with specific skills and capabilities are assigned across multiple projects or are assigned to a project on a part-time basis. This creates reporting lines to multiple people.\nTo successfully lead a project team, it is important to be aware of the following:\n● Although a project manager has formal authority within the tolerances set by the project board, the actual power structure that emerges in a project does not always reflect what has been formally agreed.\n● Due to the temporary nature of projects and the multiple reporting lines of people working on the project, project managers often rely on their ability to influence and motivate people through aligned interests and relational skills in addition to establishing the shared purpose of the project.\n● PRINCE2 defines roles that might not align with a person’s job title.\n● Team members often have competing priorities for their time and attention, which may at times conflict with the needs of the project.\n● It is not unusual for members of the project team to be more senior than the project manager, potentially causing hierarchical tension.\n● Some motivational factors may be outside of a project manager’s remit. For example, remuneration and career progression of project team members."

      "content": "In addition to those people formally assigned to a project, there are people within the business who are affected by the project, but do not work within the defined project team. They often have a role to play, for example directly contributing to the project through activities such as defining, assuring, and accepting products into the business. They may indirectly contribute by undertaking activities within their area of the business to accommodate or derive benefit from the project, such as upskilling staff, changing ways of working, or integrating new products into their area of the organization.\nWhen these activities are outside of the defined project scope, it is important to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the dependencies on such activities, who is responsible for undertaking them, and how they will be funded and monitored. If this type of work is not managed carefully, projects can be delayed or fail to achieve their benefits.\nLeading people beyond a project’s direct authority (often across organizational boundaries) requires a degree of cultural intelligence. Cultural intelligence is the capability to relate and work across cultures within the organizational ecosystem. Successfully working across cultures requires:\n● teams to adapt and find ways to successfully interface with each other\n● setting clear project boundaries within which people can flex\n● establishing the right conditions for people to succeed\n● awareness of and means to consider the many different perspectives that may exist in the project (such awareness is often referred to as emotional intelligence)\n● awareness of the constraints people work within, including different pulls on their time and attention."

It is important to understand the competencies and capabilities of the people recruited or assigned to a project, and ensure any gaps are identified and mitigations established to cover them, such as upskilling or shifting responsibilities for certain tasks to more appropriate people. Even when people technically have the same capabilities and competencies, they are likely to perform the same role differently. Sometimes, the same person may perform differently depending on who they are working with.\nAs temporary organizations, project teams may not have worked together before and may need to quickly discover how to work together effectively. It can help accelerate team building by using structured exercises that focus on building not only self-awareness and self-management but also an understanding of other’s perspectives. This can build trust and find compatible ways of working.\nRoles and responsibilities should reflect the capability, authority, and availability of the individual undertaking the work and should be considered through the lens of their key relationships. They should be reviewed in the event of any shifts in these key relationships and updated accordingly."

All members of a project team are responsible for creating this psychological safety for each other through their day-to-day interactions and by caring for each other’s wellbeing. Team members may also need space to experiment, inspect, adapt, self-organize, and adjust their ways of working.\nPRINCE2 supports building effective teams through the:\n● Project plan This explains the team’s goals to create a clear sense of purpose and provides an ability to answer questions from stakeholders.\n● Project management team structure and the role descriptions These explain the structure of the team and their associated roles, responsibilities, and relationships to support developing key relationships and identifying any coaching or training needs (such as influencing skills and how to handle resistance to the change).\n● Communication management approach This explains how team members will actively engage with and support each other and how relationships will be developed between different groups within the wider project ecosystem.\n● Project initiation documentation This explains the agreed ways of working, empowering the team to remain focused on delivering the project outcomes.\n● Product based planning This approach places great emphasis on getting agreement on what will meet user needs (product description) and also clarifying the dependencies and sequencing of key outputs (products).\nWhether projects are delivered virtually, in person, or through a hybrid approach, the way in which people work with each other needs to be carefully considered, both to optimize the use of people’s time and to build social cohesion. Social cohesion is developed by:\n● people meeting in a purposeful way on a regular basis and building trust across organizational or project silos\n● considering how key relationships will be developed and maintained over the length of the project to build resilience for when inevitable hurdles are encountered\n● considering the benefits of co-locating an office-based project team to facilitate the organic relationship building that occurs during non-structured activities (such as conversations over the desk partition, in the communal kitchen, in corridors between meetings, shared lunches, and social events).\nWhen teams are virtual, located at a distance from each other, or hybrid, building social cohesion may need additional activities such as:\n● syncing co-location days for key people and teams with a focus on building key relationships\n● allowing time for less structured conversations online\n● holding ‘away days’ for virtual teams\n● using virtual collaboration tools to enhance effectiveness and efficiency of virtual ways of working\n● providing opportunities or incentives for people to meet and socialize face-to-face."

      "content": "Scenario: bringing the team together/social cohesion\nEveryone involved in the new product development (part of the FindefTwo programme) has been under pressure to deliver the second stage of the project. This is because the programme board wants to complete the high-level design before the next quarterly leadership board meeting.\nAlthough the team managed to deliver on time, this was not without issues. It was found that working across multiple time zones and in virtual teams exhausted individuals, resulting in low team morale.\nThe project manager is aware of this, and before the detailed design starts for product 1, decides to bring the team together for a ‘pause and reflect’ day. This is a full day of team building activities that offer an opportunity to share lessons, re-energize for the upcoming stage, and build social cohesion within the team.\nTo ensure that the unity of the team is not lost after the ‘pause and reflect’ day, certain changes have been agreed. There will be regular project update webinars at different times of day to allow those in different time zones to attend. There will also be a ‘virtual coffee time’ in the internal social network platform, giving members of the team an opportunity to interact with each other informally.\nWhether it is the primary function of the project or a by-product, projects create change in organizations. As such, projects are often subject to high levels of scrutiny and open to misconceptions regarding their purpose and impact. Without a clear approach to communications, this can lead to unnecessary barriers in implementing any changes, as people seek to protect the current situation or to limit the perceived negative impact of the project.\nPRINCE2 addresses communication in a communication management approach.\nManagement product: Communication management approach\nThe communication management approach is part of the project initiation documentation.\nPurpose\nTo define and describe the means and frequency of communication with and receiving feedback from across the project ecosystem, supporting alignment and shaping of the project. It facilitates engagement with stakeholders through the establishment of a controlled and bidirectional flow of information.\nHigh-level content\nScope describes what communication will be managed by the project\nStakeholder analysis identification and analysis of those impacted by the outcome of a project or by the process of delivering the project and those who have the influence to impact the success or failure of the project\nCommunications schedule and procedure(s) for each stakeholder group: purpose, frequency, channels/format, messaging, and so on\nResponsibilities for the communication activities\nResources for the communications activities; for example, public affairs or internal communications\nSupporting tools and techniques for the communication activities; for example, communications platforms or tools for analytics or automation\nStandards any standards that apply to communication activities; for example, public engagement standards and ethical standards\nReferences for any associated documents or products.\nA communication management approach is equally about listening as it is about broadcasting. It seeks to understand the perceptions and concerns within the project ecosystem so they can be addressed before they become more significant risks. This also allows messaging to be tailored to the concerns and interests of different groups within the project ecosystem and the wider organizational ecosystem.\nGeneric messaging is rarely effective, as people obtain information from a variety of channels. Identifying and working with key influencers from the user, supplier, and business stakeholder groups helps to accommodate different perspectives. This ensures strong feedback loops and the ability to tailor messaging for each of these groups.\nGiven the number of communication channels and how interconnected the digital landscape is, attempting to control the messaging on a project can be challenging. This can be made more manageable by ensuring that key influencers help shape messaging and support communications.\nMost communication within organizations occurs outside of formal channels. Therefore, it is best to accept this and provide information in multiple formats that people can share easily and provide multiple pathways for people to give feedback.\nHow project teams communicate will also depend on whether they are co-located, remote, or hybrid:\n● Co-located teams Information tends to be shared organically through both formal and informal networks. The focus is on:\n● providing information in multiple formats which can be easily shared through these networks\n● monitoring whether information is flowing freely throughout the project ecosystem\n● identifying any team members or groups who are disconnected and working to reconnect them.\n● Remote teams A more deliberate and structured approach is required to ensure information is flowing through the project ecosystem. The focus is on:\n● building in time to allow for unstructured listening and sharing of information\n● seeking clarity on how information is flowing through the project ecosystem and providing information in appropriate formats to facilitate this\n● identifying key relationships and agreeing how they will build both structured and unstructured time together.\n● Hybrid teams Hybrid teams’ means of communication must ensure the project does not develop separate groups who are more involved or less involved because of their location.\nScenario: two team leaders meeting for coffee\nData Knowledge’s iterative approach for the development of a new time-recording solution allows for early feedback to be incorporated. It made the data science team leader and the development team leader realize that they needed to be aligned. They agreed to meet for a coffee every two weeks for a general catch-up in a local park, as they usually met virtually. The company provided coffee vouchers at a central coffee shop, encouraging people to accompany each other for coffee whenever they are in town.\nOn one occasion, the data science team leader was unsure of the level of detail to be captured in the solution and related reports. Specifically, they had to decide if it would be sufficient to record how many hours per project each resource carries out, or if it would also be useful to have that information at the task-level.\nOn one hand, reporting at the task level would give assurance to project managers that the team is allocating their time to priority tasks; on the other hand, reporting at this low level would be a significant cultural change and the staff could be uncomfortable with such level of scrutiny.\nThe two team leaders exchanged ideas over coffee and agreed that reporting at the task-level would be too much. A decision was easily reached to report time at the project level only.\nThe communication management approach is likely to evolve as the project evolves and becomes more defined. For complex projects with a wide impact, it can be useful to develop the project with a smaller group of key influencers in what is sometimes referred to as a ‘quiet phase’.\nA ‘quiet phase’ will keep wider communications to a minimum until the project is better defined and minimize the spread of misinformation or rumours (this is especially important when a project is politically sensitive and may be of interest to the general public).\nIt is insufficient to rely solely on periodic reporting to determine how a project is progressing. Reporting can be subject to bias as people might subconsciously manipulate information based on what is considered acceptable, expected, or desirable.\nAn open and transparent environment can reduce the level of bias. However, it is important to have additional pathways to obtain feedback in the project, such as building strong relationships with key influencers and monitoring the health of key relationships within the project ecosystem.\nPockets of resistance to the project are a useful indicator of where communications should be focused. In taking the time to listen to the concerns raised, misconceptions can be identified, and issues can be addressed."

To minimize the risk of incorrect information being shared and rumours spreading, the project team has decided to contain wider communications to a minimum until the project is defined. Following this, BuildyBrick established a full communication strategy.\nFor that purpose, the project team has invited key influencers from the local neighbourhood to join a monthly communication planning meeting. Together, these selected influencers will suggest ideas and work closely with the project team on the communication messages, formats, and vehicles to use when the time comes to communicate a clear message to the local community.\nThis chapter explains three people-focused activities: leading successful change, leading successful teams, and communication.\nThese are not standalone activities as they influence all aspects of project management. As illustrated in figure 3.3, leading successful change, leading successful teams, and communication are central to the PRINCE2 method.\nPRINCE2 is a project management method composed of five integrated elements: principles, people, practices, processes, and the project context.

This ensures people factors are continually addressed throughout the project’s lifecycle.\nPeople factors permeate the other principles as illustrated below.\nEnsure continued business justification\n● Organizations are fundamentally a collection of people interacting with each other around the core purposes of that organization. The business justification for a project needs to satisfy all three project interests: user, business, and supplier. Defining a project that aligns all of these interests can take time and effort. Therefore, it is important to consider the dynamics of the key relationships relating to these interests, as they impact how agreement is reached and determine whether the project continues to be valid. Moreover, it is crucial to recognize that what is considered justification may change when roles change.\n● Business justification can be perception-based, so the communication management approach is a key enabler to ensure ongoing perceived business justification by managing key relationships and showcasing progress to demonstrate value.\nLearn from experience\n● There is significant value in learning from visible knowledge, such as business books and captured learning, but there is valuable knowledge hidden within a project ecosystem. This requires a collaborative environment that encourages knowledge sharing throughout the lifetime of a project. Knowledge sharing enables people to benefit from each other’s experience.\n● In particular, people factors such as behaviours, culture, and relationships are difficult to document and are best learned through social learning. For example, team members connecting and learning from people who have worked on an earlier stage or other projects with similar characteristics.\nManage by stages\n● The stages of a project often mark a change in the influencers and any key relationships. They are good points to review how the project is planned to deliver, ensuring it remains aligned with how people interact with each other and the wider organizational ecosystem. Stage boundaries often mark a transition in the organizational design (see Chapter 6).\n● Stage boundaries provide a more controlled way to review the skills needed for the next delivery stages and make changes, even to the Project Board. It is better to have the right people managing the project rather than people who are unable to effectively contribute.\nManage by exception\n● Decisions should be made at the most local level where the knowledge needed to make and own those decisions resides. Decisions should be progressed through the levels when a decision has the potential to impact other areas of the project. Therefore, it requires different perspectives to be considered, or it will have a wider impact outside of the project boundaries.\n● The extent of delegation is often dependent on the level of confidence and trust that exists in the key relationships and will adapt over the life of a project in response to the skills and capabilities of individuals. Improving confidence and trust improves the ability to manage by exception.\nFocus on products\n● Co-creating products, with agreed product descriptions, with the business, user, and supplier communities unites their different perspectives. This improves the development and adoption of the products into the business, reducing handover risks and ensuring that operational and maintenance issues are fully considered.\nTailor to suit the project context\n● Tailoring supports the ability to adapt the PRINCE2 method to the people and organizations involved, rather than attempting to adapt them to the method.\n● Tailoring is based on the level of capability or project management maturity, which will evolve over time as people gain a better understanding of PRINCE2 principles, practices, and processes."

The practices require specific treatment of that aspect of project management for the PRINCE2 processes to be effective.\nThe PRINCE2 practices describe aspects of project management that must be continually addressed as the project progresses through its lifecycle. For example, the business case for the project must be updated and revalidated throughout the project lifecycle as issues will occur, and risks need to be managed. The strength of PRINCE2 is the way in which the seven practices are integrated, both in how they link together and are used across all the PRINCE2 processes.\nThe PRINCE2 processes (see Chapters 12 to 19) address the progressive flow of the project (the lifecycle), describing actions relating to each of the practices when they are needed.

This will include the way the PRINCE2 practices are applied. This may range from the business providing standards or prescriptive guidelines to allowing the project management team a large degree of freedom as to how they apply each practice to the project.\nThe PRINCE2 practices are designed to help the project management team apply and tailor the method, principally through a suite of management approaches (such as the benefits management approach). Each management approach defines the procedures, techniques, and standards to be applied and the responsibilities for that aspect of project management to be effective.\nPRINCE2 does not prescribe how procedures, techniques, and standards should be documented, the level of detail required, or how they are published and shared. The level of detail could vary from a few paragraphs to a comprehensive instruction manual. The level and type of documentation is established by the Project Board who will consider what they need to manage and document their decisions within agreed business policies.\nContextual factors such as importance, risk, and urgency of the project will influence the level of control required, which will determine the degree of formality and frequency of monitoring, reviewing, reporting, and decision-making. The organizations involved and the relationship between them (for example, customer and supplier) will also influence the controls that will be established. Whether the project is part of a wider programme or portfolio will influence how the project management team interacts with the business and incorporates their management requirements. When applying the PRINCE2 practices, project management teams should also reflect any tailoring of the roles, processes, and terminology.\nAll seven practices should be applied in a project. However, they vary according to the scale, risk, the people and organizations involved, and the complexity or simplicity of the project concerned. This will always ensure that the method remains consistent with the seven PRINCE2 principles.\nThis book contains suggestions for how each practice can be applied to the project’s context based on some common factors, such as a project in a programme or a project using an agile delivery method."

Its component products will need to be updated and re-baselined, as necessary, at the end of each stage to reflect the current status of its constituent parts. The version of the project initiation documentation that was used to gain authorization for the project is preserved as the basis against which performance will later be assessed when closing the project.\nThe components of the project initiation documentation are described in more detail throughout the practice chapters (Chapters 5 to 11). However, at the end of every stage, each component of this documentation is reviewed for currency, and if required structured changes should be made. The baseline version is always preserved."

These measurable improvements are called benefits. In cases of compliance or regulatory projects, the benefits may be compared to the consequences of inaction.\nPRINCE2 projects deliver outputs in the form of products which are used to facilitate changes in an organization or for organizations. These changes create capabilities that lead to outcomes. The outcomes allow the organization(s) to realize the benefits that are explained in the business case for the project. Outcomes that are perceived as negative by one or more stakeholders are called dis-benefits.\nFigure 5.1 Relationship between outputs, outcomes, and benefits\nDefinitions:\nOutput The tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity. In PRINCE2, outputs are the specialist products that will be used to enable change.\nCapability The completed set of project outputs required to deliver an outcome.\nOutcome The result of change, normally affecting real-world behaviour and circumstances. Changes are implemented to achieve outcomes, which are achieved as a result of the activities undertaken to facilitate the change.\nBenefit The measurable improvement resulting from an outcome that is perceived as an advantage by the investing organization and contributes towards one or more business objectives.\nDis-benefit The measurable decline resulting from an outcome perceived as negative by the investing organization and which detracts from one or more business objectives.\nBusiness objective The measurable outcomes that demonstrate progress in relation to the organization’s strategy and to which the project should contribute.\nAll projects must have a business justification, usually documented in a business case. The business case establishes not only the reason for the project but also confirms whether the project is:\n● desirable (the balance of costs, benefits, and risks)\n● viable (able to deliver the products)\n● achievable (whether use of the products is likely to result in envisaged outcomes and resulting benefits).\nBusiness justification is not only about costs but also about understanding the value of a project. It is the perceived benefits or importance of the outcomes in proportion to the resources deployed to achieve them. Moreover, business justification is about selecting an approach that offers the best overall value.\nIt is a PRINCE2 principle that a project must ensure continued business justification. This requires that the business justification is established at the beginning of the project through the creation of a business case and then kept under regular review and updated in response to the decisions and events that might impact the desirability, viability, or achievability of the project. If the business justification ceases to be valid, the project should be stopped or changed.\nScenario: desirable, viable, but not achievable (NowByou example: project board asked sponsor to redefine project scope because proposed communication vehicles deemed unlikely to reach intended audience, making outcomes unachievable.)"

      "content": "The theory of the links between outputs, outcomes, and benefits is straightforward. However, putting theory into practice is often much more difficult. Many organizations will be able to identify projects that have produced products that were never fully used or organizational changes that were never fully embedded. For benefits to be realized, the outcomes must be achieved, which means that the outputs from the project are used as intended, new capability is defined, and barriers to the use of the new capability are identified.\nA problem that commonly occurs is that projects are often successful from a delivery perspective but fail from an investment perspective. As the project’s outcomes and benefits are often only realized after the project has closed, it is easy for project teams to become focused solely on creating products (the outputs). The link from the project’s outputs to outcomes and benefits needs to be clearly identified and made visible to those involved in the project. Otherwise, there is a danger that the original purpose of the project can get lost, and the benefits will not be realized. Some products are enablers for other products to generate benefits.\nUltimately, the outcomes and benefits to be achieved from the project need to align with and contribute to the business objectives. These may include environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals set by the organization. The sustainability performance targets and tolerances for the project, documented in the business case, should reference and contribute to the ESG goals of the organization (see section 5.4.4 for more information on sustainability).\nThe benefits management approach that supports the business case includes the amount and timing of benefits forecast to be achieved by the project and additional guidance relating to the tolerance against these targets (such as a 10–15 percent increase in sales). Forecast benefits are checked through the project (at a minimum at the end of every stage), and if they fall outside of set tolerances, they should be escalated to the appropriate level for review and action. Ensuring benefits are measurable also ensures that they can be demonstrated. If the project includes benefits that cannot be measured, it is impossible to determine whether it has been a success or provided value for money."

      "content": "All seven aspects of the project’s performance targets (see 1.4) and their relationships with each other should be considered as part of assessing the business justification, but there will often be trade-offs between different performance aspects. For example, if in developing the project product description it is decided that higher quality targets are required, it is likely to impact the cost, time, or sustainability targets.\nThe business case considers options to achieve the required outcomes (PRINCE2 refers to these outcomes as the ‘business options’) and selects the option that gives the best balance between the different performance aspects. If a project cannot build a business case within the tolerances set for all seven performance aspects, then its justification may be questionable.\nThe business case should include not only the costs of developing the project product but also any changes to operational costs when the project concludes. Most organizations have policies that define how these costs should be considered in their business cases.\nDis-benefits are expected consequences of an activity, whereas a risk is uncertain and may never materialize. For example, a decision to merge two elements of an organization into a new site may have benefits (such as better joint working), costs (such as expanding one of the two sites), and dis-benefits (such as limited public transport options to the new site). Dis-benefits need to be valued and incorporated into the investment appraisal."

An alternative procedure can be used in its place if desired, for example, if the business has already developed a procedure specific to their organization. The use of an alternative procedure should be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nThe business case is developed in outline and then in detail at the beginning of the project. It is reviewed and updated as it develops and evolves throughout the life of the project (see figure 5.2). It is checked by the project board at each key decision point (such as at stage boundaries) and confirmed throughout the period that benefits accrue.\nFigure 5.3 Business case through the project lifecycle\nIn figure 5.3 above:\n● develop means to explore options and get the right information upon which investment appraisal decisions can be made\n● check means to assess whether the project is (still) worthwhile\n● maintain means to keep the business case updated with actual progress and current forecasts (including forecast benefits)\n● confirm means to assess whether the intended benefits have been (or will be) realized. Confirming benefits will mostly take place after the project has been closed, although benefits may be realized during the project when products are delivered and released iteratively.\n5.3.1.1 Develop\nThe provision of a project mandate activates the process of starting up a project. The project mandate is then used as an input to develop the initial business justification for the project documented in the outline business case as part of the project brief. In the process of directing a project, the project brief is approved by the project board when authorizing the project initiation. The outline business case is refined into a full business case during the process of initiating a project. The project board approves this when authorizing the project.\nThere are three basic business options concerning any investment:\n● do nothing differently\n● do the minimum\n● do more than the minimum.\nThe ‘do nothing differently’ option should always be the first option and act as the basis for quantifying the other options. The difference between do nothing differently, do the minimum, or do more than the minimum is the benefit that the investment will buy.\nThe analysis of each option provides the project board and the project’s stakeholders with sufficient information to determine which option presents the best value for the organization. It answers the question: for this level of investment, are the expected benefits more desirable, viable, and achievable than the other available options? See 5.3.2.1 Investment Appraisal techniques for a summary of some of the ways in which options can be evaluated and compared.\nDuring the early stages of a project, there may be a wide range of options under consideration, and subsequently, the number of options will be reduced so that they can be examined in more detail. It is important for all projects including those classified as ‘must do’ (such as regulatory projects) to explore different options and select the most appropriate. There may be different approaches available that must be evaluated in terms of their viability, desirability, and achievability.\nScenario: do nothing/minimum/something options appraisal (NowByou example: 'do more than the minimum' option is preferred due to attractive value for money.)\n5.3.1.2 Check\nThe business case for the chosen option should be continually assessed for desirability, viability, and achievability, as any new risks or changes might justify switching to another option.\nThe business case may undergo further refinement and will be updated across stages as project costs, timescale, products, and risks are further understood. Continued business justification drives all decision-making by ensuring that the business objectives and benefits being sought can continue to be realized. As a minimum, the project board should check the business case:\n● at the end of the process of starting up a project to authorize project initiation\n● at the end of the process of initiating a project to authorize the project\n● at the end of each stage to authorize the next stage and the continuation of the project\n● when assessing an exception plan to authorize the revised stage and continuation of the project.\nThe project manager will also check the business case:\n● when assessing progress, risks, and issues to determine their impact on the business justification\n● during the final stage, as part of closing a project, to assess the project’s performance against requirements and the probability that the outcomes will provide the expected benefits\n● when consulting with stakeholders to determine whether any goals have changed (such as whether any additional sustainability objectives have been established by the business).\nThere are many ways to check the expected benefits. For example, sensitivity analysis can be used to determine whether the business case is heavily dependent on a specific benefit. If it is, this may affect project planning, monitoring and control activities, and risk management, as steps would need to be taken to protect that specific benefit.\n5.3.1.3 Maintain\nAt the end of each stage, the project manager updates the business case with the progress data (such as products delivered, projects costs, benefits realized) and the latest forecasted benefits and performance targets. It is important to maintain the business case with appropriate version control so that previous versions can be accessed for reference and comparison.\n5.3.1.4 Confirm\nThe business will review the business case as part of a post-project benefits review to determine the project outcomes in realizing their benefits. They will also assess whether the intended benefits have been realized in practice. During the project, benefits reviews should be conducted at stage boundaries to confirm that any benefits forecast to be achieved during the project are on track to be realized.\nAs shown in figure 5.1 (see section 5.1), projects deliver outputs, and the use of those outputs will result in outcomes that provide benefits to the business. It is important that the project management team understands the benefits and outcomes the project should realize. Otherwise, it is unlikely to be able to develop the right outputs or build and sustain commitment to the changes during the project’s lifespan.\nThe senior user, who is responsible for specifying the benefits from the project, is also accountable for confirming that the forecast benefits are realized. This may involve a commitment beyond the life of the project, as it is likely that many benefits will not be realized until after the project has closed. For this reason, it is usually advisable that the senior user comes from an area of the business impacted by the change. However, this poses a dilemma because when the project closes, the ‘temporary organization’ is disbanded along with the framework (and in particular the funding and resources) to perform any measurement activities.\nThe benefits management approach defines the management actions that will be established to ensure that the project’s outcomes are achieved and to confirm that the project’s benefits are realized. It is first created by the project manager in the ‘initiating a project’ process during the initiation stage and is submitted to the project board for approval when seeking project authorization. If the business is to manage or participate in the benefits reviews, the project board may need to seek its approval. The benefits management approach may be managed by the project or by the business and is likely to be managed beyond the life of the project.\nAny benefits that can be measured during the life of a project should be confirmed by the senior user for formal reporting by the project manager in the end stage reports and end project report. When benefits can be reviewed during the life of the project, the benefits management approach should include appropriate mid-project benefits reviews. Any forecast benefits that are unrealized should be re-examined and their forecasts updated as part of the ‘managing a stage boundary’ process.\nPost-project benefits reviews will involve the business holding the senior user accountable by asking for evidence of how the individual benefits allocated to them have been realized, with corrective actions taken to achieve benefits that have not been fully realized. The post-project benefits reviews will also review the performance of the project product in operational use and identify whether there have been any side effects (beneficial or adverse) that may provide useful lessons for other projects.\nThe project executive is responsible for ensuring that benefits reviews are planned and executed. For post-project measurement activities, the responsibility for benefits reviews transfers from the project executive to the business (specifically the senior user) when the project closes, as the reviews will need to be funded and resourced."

      "content": "5.3.2.1 Investment appraisal\nAn investment appraisal compares the costs of developing, operating, and maintaining the project product with the value of the benefits over a period of time. The investment appraisal looks at the relationship between benefits, costs, and risks. It should cover both the project costs (both in producing the required products and the project management costs) and the ongoing operations and maintenance costs.\nThere are many investment appraisal techniques available to organizations that will often have preferences on which technique to adopt for specific projects. The selection of techniques may be influenced by the type of business (such as those that have to follow public sector accounting rules) or the organization’s own standards.\nExamples of investment appraisal techniques include the following:\n● Whole life costs analysing the total cost of implementation and any incremental transitional, operational, and maintenance costs\n● Net benefits analysing the total value of the benefits minus the cost of implementation, transition, and ongoing operation, calculated over a defined period\n● Return on investment (ROI) profits or savings resulting from investments expressed as a percentage of the initial investment\n● Payback a measure of time to remunerate the investment of cash and other resources\n● Net present value (NPV) an amount of money that the investment will have earned by a particular point in time that considers the time value of money using a discount rate to determine discounted cash flows (For example, if the discount rate is six percent, the value of money halves approximately every 12 years. Therefore, if a project is forecasting a £500,000 benefit to materialize in year 12, then it is only worth £250,000 in today’s money.)\n● Internal rate of return a percentage that indicates the rate of return on investment when the NPV is zero\n● Options analysis a comparison of the options by scoring each option against weighted assessment criteria to help identify a preferred option (Pairwise comparison can also be used to differentiate between options to establish the shortlist and preferred option.)\n● Sensitivity analysis adjusting the input factors to model the point at which the output factors no longer justify the investment.\n● For example, a project might be worthwhile if it can be done in four months but ceases to be worthwhile if it was to take six months.\n● Business cases are based on uncertain forecasts. To identify how robust the business case is, it is useful to understand the relationship between input factors (such as project costs, timescale, quality, scope, and project risks) and output factors (such as operations and maintenance costs, business benefits, and business risks).\n5.3.2.2 Multi-case model\nEvaluating investments from different perspectives, rather than focusing solely on financial return, gives a rounded view of whether an investment is desirable, viable, and achievable. Examples of some different investment perspectives include:\n● Strategic perspective understanding the drivers for change and demonstrating how the investment provides strategic fit\n● Economic perspective identifying the option that delivers best value, including wider social, environmental, and sustainability considerations\n● Financial perspective assessing affordability, funding, budgeting, and cashflow over the life of the project and project product\n● Implementation and commercial perspective showing that the preferred option can be delivered by service providers and that robust arrangements are established for successful project delivery.\nFor an investment to be robust, it should be able to demonstrate that it satisfies all these perspectives. The business may have developed its own set of cases for developing business cases, such as an environmental case, and policies regarding their use.\n5.3.2.3 Best, expected, and worst-case scenarios for benefits\nWhen using iterative-incremental approach, such as agile, the scope of the project is typically flexible in order to embrace adaptability and to reassure the project will be completed in the fixed time and budget. Therefore, benefits should be expressed not as a target estimate but rather in the form of a range, relating to the amount of scope delivered.\nOne way to present the estimation of the benefits is to present different scenarios for the scope and the benefits in a business case, for example:\n● best-case scenario describing benefits expected when all (must-, should-, and could-have) requirements are delivered\n● expected-case scenario describing benefits expected when must-have and should-have requirements are delivered\n● worst-case scenario describing benefits expected when only must-have requirements are delivered.\nThe worst-case scenario showing the lowest expectation of the amount of scope delivered should also show that the project is still viable."

The other justification aspects of the project business case should be in the programme business case.\nBenefits will usually be defined, tracked, and managed by the programme management team, and the project’s benefits management approach may be part of the programme’s benefits realization plan."

In other words, that it would be worthwhile from the supplier’s perspective. \nSuccessful projects ensure these business cases are aligned and compatible recognizing that there may be elements of each business case that are private to each organization. It is the responsibility of the project executive to ensure compatibility through the alignment of the three project interests of the user, the business, and the supplier on the project board."

Additionally, it may also need details of the extent and sequence of the scope to be delivered. Given the fixed cost and time, one way to present a business case is to show the best case, expected case, and worst case of the scope that can be used.\nWhen creating a business case, it is important to understand how incremental delivery of a product and the value associated with it could impact the project’s viability (positively or negatively) and also the ability to achieve the early realization of some benefits. If there is a high level of uncertainty, the business case should be developed, and the assumptions should be tested quickly. \nWhen using an iterative-incremental delivery method such as agile, the understanding of what is to be delivered will increase throughout the project together with understanding the benefits. Thus, the business case would evolve much more during the lifecycle of the project than for a linear-sequential project. The business case may also be framed as having a worst-case scenario when only the “must have” requirements are delivered and an expected-case scenario when the “must haves” and “should haves” are delivered and a best-case scenario when the “could haves” are also delivered."

It is important that the sustainability targets for the project align with the organization’s broader objectives and any ESG targets it has defined.\nIf a project’s primary purpose is to satisfy a sustainability objective, then using traditional methods of investment appraisal may not be effective when assessing its business justification. For example, a project to build a flood defence barrier, where benefits may not be achieved for 20 or 30 years, may be difficult to justify using discounted cash flow methods, where the future value of money, and therefore benefits, is worth less than today. The approach to assessing business justification may need to be adapted for this type of project.\nScenario: sustainability as a trade-off in options appraisal (LouisShopping example: decision made to use a balanced ventilation system and double-glazed windows, prioritizing net zero commitment and managing high-level risk of untested solutions.)"

They are responsible for effectively governing the project in a way that is aligned to the business strategy, including ensuring longer-term thinking on topics such as environmental, social, and economic impacts.\nThere cannot be more than one project executive role, and the role cannot be combined with the project manager role. In organizations where there is a job-sharing scheme, there is still a one-to-one allocation of the business role (job) to the project role (project executive). However, additional arrangements may be needed to ensure clarity on how the single point of accountability will be maintained by the job holders who share the business role. The business’ policies and guidance relating to job-sharing are likely to address such scenarios, and they should be reflected in the project executive’s role description and the project initiation documentation.\n6.2.4.2 Senior user\nThe senior user represents the user community and is accountable for the approach taken to capture user requirements and the specification of benefits aligned to the business case. The senior user is responsible for:\n● ensuring the approach gains user buy-in to the project\n● monitoring the products against the requirements in line with the business case\n● demonstrating to the business that the forecasted benefits in the business case are on track to being realized\n● controlling change to requirements and benefits, whether arising from the users, the business, or the project itself\n● the successful handover and adoption of products into the business and continued realization of benefits after the project has closed.\nThe senior user must ensure sufficient ongoing commitment from people in the user community to support these activities, in particular where there is a longer-term commitment beyond the lifespan of the project, such as the realization of benefits.\nDepending on the scale and complexity of the user community, more than one person may be required to represent the users, but this should be kept to a minimum.\n6.2.4.3 Senior supplier\nThe senior supplier represents the supplier community that is involved in all aspects of delivering the project products. The senior supplier must ensure sufficient ongoing commitment of people and resources from the supplier organization(s) to support the project work. The senior supplier is accountable for the quality of the products delivered by the suppliers and for the technical integrity of the project.\nIn many cases, the senior supplier also represents the interests of those who will provide the maintenance services for the specialist products after closure of the project (for example, engineering maintenance and support).\nExceptions to this do occur, however (for example, when the maintenance services are provided by the business, such as an internal IT department, or are outsourced to a different supplier). In this instance the operations and maintenance interests are more likely to be represented by a senior user. The distinction is not really important; what matters is that operations, service and support interests are represented appropriately from the outset.\nDepending on the scale and complexity of the supplier community, more than one person may be required to represent the suppliers, but this should be kept to a minimum.\n6.2.4.4 Project board\nAll PRINCE2 projects must have a project board comprising the project executive, senior user, and senior supplier roles. On smaller and less complex projects, the role of the project executive can be combined with the role of the senior user or the senior supplier. It is not recommended to combine the senior user and senior supplier roles to avoid conflicts of interest in decision-making and ensure that the perspectives and interests of the user and supplier communities are adequately represented on the project.\nThe project board has authority and responsibility for the project within the project tolerances set by the business, often captured in a project mandate. They are responsible for creating the right environment for the project to succeed, including:\n● having sufficient funding, people, and resources to deliver the project objectives\n● establishing clear feedback loops to support adapting and evolving the project\n● assuring all aspects of the project’s performance and products independently of the project manager\n● ensuring business strategy and objectives are reflected in the business case\n● ensuring the project and its management approaches are aligned to the business’ environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitments\n● setting stage tolerances to enable management by exception\n● governing the project and determining the rules, constraints, shared values, and perspectives needed to guide decision-making at all levels\n● establishing the tolerances and change budget to support effective decision-making\n● focusing on the safety and well-being of the project team\n● monitoring and supporting social cohesion within the project ecosystem\n● managing relationships at the interface of the organizational ecosystem and project ecosystem.\nAn effective project board requires the right level of authority for the nature and scale of the project and credibility across the project ecosystem.\n6.2.4.5 Project manager\nThe project manager has the authority to run the project on behalf of the project board within the agreed project tolerances and constraints. They are responsible for day-to-day management of a project, including:\n● managing and, where appropriate, delegating the work to the team managers or team members\n● setting the work package tolerances and constraints for the team managers and project support roles to work within\n● ensuring decisions are being made in line with the project board guidance and tolerances\n● managing relationships within the project ecosystem, including project assurance roles and the project board\n● monitoring and supporting the safety and well-being of team members and the sustainability of the project approach.\nDepending on the scale and complexity of the project and the skill and capacity of the project manager, the project manager may also perform the team manager and project support roles or delegate these directly to team members. The responsibility of the project manager as a single focus means the role should not be shared or combined with other roles.\nIn organizations where there is a job-sharing scheme, there is still a one-to-one allocation of the business role (job) to the project role (project manager). However, additional arrangements may be needed to ensure clarity on how the single point of accountability will be maintained by the job holders who share the business role. The business’ policies and guidance relating to job-sharing are likely to address such scenarios. The policies should be reflected in the project manager’s role description and the project initiation documentation\n6.2.4.6 Team manager\nTeam managers are responsible for delivering the work allocated to them within the tolerances and constraints agreed with the project manager. The project manager allocates work to a team manager in the form of work package, in line with the commercial management approach. The team manager is responsible for:\n● delivering the products to the agreed specifications\n● setting the tolerances and constraints for team members to work within\n● ensuring any decisions their team needs to make is in line with the project manager’s guidance and the tolerances\n● managing relationships both within their team and any interfaces with other teams, the project manager, project assurance, and project support\n● monitoring and supporting the safety and well-being of team members and the sustainability of the team’s approach.\nScenario: role of the team manager and who this might be (LouisShopping example: Team managers are principal electrical building services engineer and maintenance plumber from BuildyBrick for respective teams.)\nScenario: role of the team manager in the self-organizing agile team (Data Knowledge example: Team manager role collectively held by self-organizing agile team, with one single point of contact for the Project Manager.)\n6.2.4.7 Project assurance\nProject board members are accountable for the assurance of their respective areas of concern (business assurance, user assurance, supplier assurance). The project board is responsible for establishing how project assurance will be undertaken, ensuring clarity in the roles and responsibilities and how those appointed to assurance roles will interact with each other. Subject to who has the knowledge, skills, and capacity to support the project team, the assurance tasks can be undertaken by the board member themselves, appointed from the wider business, or selected from an external party. Project assurance roles cannot be assigned to the project manager, team manager, project team members, nor the project support. Where the project assurance roles are delegated, the respective project board member remains accountable.\n6.2.4.8 Project support\nProject support is responsible for providing services such as, administrative support, facilitating meetings and workshops, advice and guidance on the project tools, planning support, risk management, issue management, and change management.\nAlthough the role is the responsibility of the project manager, it can be delegated to suppliers, individuals, or groups within the business or to other team members. This is dependent on the scale and complexity of the project and the skills, knowledge, and capacity of the project manager. Some organizations establish a project office to support the delivery of projects, which can fulfil this role (see Portfolio, Programme and Project Offices P3O).\nProject support can help with integration across the project ecosystem, including gaining feedback to aid improvements to the ways of working, evolving the project direction, and building social cohesion.\nProject support must be kept separate from project assurance roles to maintain the independence of assurance."

The work breakdown structure creates a link between the work packages and the product breakdown structure (see Chapter 7), supporting the project manager in determining how to structure project teams and the boundaries between them.\nThe work breakdown structure is most useful when there are multiple work packages and particularly when there is a mix of internally staffed and externally supplied work packages. For the former, it makes clear the level of effort of internal staff, and for the latter, it is useful in creating a statement of the work required. However, for a very simple project, such as the delivery of just one work package with a small team, a work breakdown structure would not be required.\nIf a single work package is being used in the project, it is best that it does not include both internal and external team members. There is a fundamentally different character and set of relationships between an internal agreement and an external contract. Therefore, it is better to manage them separately."

      "content": "A number of the areas mentioned in Chapter 3 (People) can be addressed by proactive organizational design and development, including culture, collaboration, relationships, and ultimately, effective project teams.\nPRINCE2 includes a five-step organizational design and development technique shown in figure 6.4. An alternative procedure can be used instead, for example, if the business has already developed a procedure specific to their organization. The use of an alternative procedure should be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nFigure 6.4 PRINCE2 technique for organizational design and development\n6.3.1.1 Understand the organizational ecosystem\nProjects unite people from organizations that already have defined organizational structures and corporate governance requirements. An understanding of the organizational ecosystem is required to successfully design the project organization and determine how the project ecosystem will develop as a distinct entity from the organizational ecosystem.\nAs a temporary organization, the project approach needs to define how the project will interface and align with the organizational ecosystem where required. There should be clarity on who retains responsibility for issues such as:\n● People management for example, performance management, rewards, advancement, and wellbeing\n● Governance for example, which decisions are subject to corporate governance or governance pathways\n● Management approaches such as policies, procedures, and ways of working\n● How and when the transition of project team members on and off the project.\n6.3.1.2 Design the project ecosystem\nProject organizational design describes how to organize work and people to achieve the project’s objectives. This includes:\n● determining the effective structure of the team\n● determining the people and resources needed\n● implementing integrated working practices\n● developing the project behaviours and culture.\nThe design occurs in response to the understanding of the needs of the project across each of its stages, the context it is working within, and the skills, capability, and capacity of the people required or assigned to the project.\nSubject to the project’s scale, complexity, project approach, and delivery method, the organizational structure may need to transition at different stages of the project, such as moving from a client-led design team to a supplier-led delivery team. Where possible, this should be identified and planned for during the initiation stage, establishing planned project management team structures at different stages. Consideration is needed regarding the people and resources needed to support the transition between these different structures and the impact of the changes on the project team.\nThe project organizational design is informed by the work breakdown structure and the commercial management approach. These will determine the number and size of teams, which organizations they come from, and the nature of any customer or supplier relationships required. The capabilities required of a project delivered by people entirely from within the business will be quite different from those required of a project mostly delivered by external suppliers.\nThe project executive, supported by the project manager, is responsible for the project organizational design. It should be documented in the project initiation documentation. Organizational design for projects requires expertise that is distinctly different from the business’ organizational design due to the temporary and ever-evolving nature of projects. Subject to the scale and complexity of the project, the project executive may need to delegate this responsibility either within the organization, if they have this skillset, or to outsource the responsibility to a specialist supplier.\nScenario: different team structures at different stages of a project (Findef example: marketing agency and training company join as suppliers in Stage 3, change manager appointed, and operations representatives involved later, requiring new teams and structures.)\n6.3.1.3 Develop the project ecosystem\nProject organizational development concerns implementing the project organizational design and adapting and evolving it as the project progresses. The project ecosystem will need ongoing development in response to changing project needs, team members, and their emerging relationships, ensuring the project is set up to deliver its objectives and to continuously improve.\nThe development activities may include:\n● onboarding people to the project, for example, a site visit, induction, or certification\n● skills and capability assessments or audits of the project team\n● training for the project team, such as on new methods or to address skills and capability gaps\n● team building\n● establishing and maintaining a specific project culture\n● succession planning including recognizing that people may leave the project before completion\n● offboarding to capture lessons.\nThe change management approach to deliver new capabilities to the organizational ecosystem (see Chapter 3) can also be used to deliver new capabilities to the project ecosystem, particularly, in the preparation of transition points, such as the appointment of a key supplier. Just as there are key influencers in the organizational ecosystem, there will also be key influencers in the project ecosystem that the project manager will need to consult and influence for the project capabilities to be successfully developed.\nThe project executive is responsible for project organizational development and is supported by the project manager. As with project organizational design, it is important to recognize that this requires people with specialist skills and resources with the appropriate capabilities.\n6.3.1.4 Manage the ongoing changes to the project ecosystem\nPeople require time to become familiar with the project and to gain the capability and develop the relationships to fulfil their roles. It is critical to have clear feedback loops established to determine whether there are any capability or capacity gaps or relational issues to address.\nThe project manager is responsible for making the best use of the people and resources available, enhancing capabilities where required. They do so by ensuring people’s responsibilities are matched to their capability and capacity, sourcing additional skills and capabilities, or upskilling people through coaching and learning opportunities.\nThe capabilities required on a project will change over the project lifecycle, requiring the project manager to ensure the commercial management approach supports this, transitioning people onto and off the project as required, and enhancing capacity and capabilities. The project manager must also ensure that a robust change management procedure is established to ensure the impact on different areas of the project ecosystem are considered in decision-making. One way this can be done is to identify the new capabilities that the products will provide and review any barriers to getting this new capability embedded into business as usual activities. Clarifying these barriers early in the project lifecycle will highlight new project risks or issues and establish expectations on a realistic time frame for benefits realization.\nA project stage is often defined by these transition points in the required capabilities. This is a good point to review the project management team structure and the associated roles and responsibilities, ensuring that the commercial management approach supports the proposed changes.\n6.3.1.5 Transition the project into the organizational ecosystem\nAs with the start of a project, at the close of a project, it is important to understand the organizational ecosystem that the products of the project and any remaining project team members will be transitioning into. There are three key aspects the project board needs to consider as part of the transition:\n● Products ensuring all products have been accepted into the business and that any ongoing activities associated with the products such as further developments, monitoring the benefits, operating, and maintaining the products are owned by appropriate areas of the business\n● People ensuring any remaining project team members are successfully transitioned back into the business or are managed in line with the commercial arrangements for external suppliers\n● Learning ensuring the most effective means for sharing lessons and using the knowledge gained, in undertaking project work, project team members may have acquired skills and capabilities that will likely benefit the wider business and organizations involved."

      "content": "Other techniques that can be used on a PRINCE2 project include delivery models or a RACI matrix.\n6.3.2.1 Delivery models\nDefinition: Delivery model\nThe organizational and commercial arrangements to be deployed to meet the project objectives given the project constraints and capabilities of the user, business, and supplier organizations. It is described in the commercial management approach and reflected in the project management team structure.\nDelivery models can range from thin client models where most of the project work is undertaken by suppliers to thick client models where most of the work is undertaken by the business. In thin client models, not only is the work to develop the project products fulfilled by external suppliers, but also much of the work to manage the project is fulfilled by external suppliers too.\nThe delivery model will define which aspects of project management will be in-house or external. It will also include whether the work fulfilled by external suppliers will be contracted on a product or labour basis. The distinction is that contracting on a labour basis means the client generally remains responsible for the performance of their work, whereas on a product basis, the supplier remains responsible for their performance.\nThe project board, in consultation with the project manager, is responsible for determining the right balance between in-house and external suppliers and the commercial arrangements required between them. This is captured in the commercial management approach.\nThe choice of delivery model can also be impacted by how unique the project is to the business. For highly unique projects or where the project could become political, the project board may choose a model with a high level of organizational input to the assurance of the work. Whereas, for more standardized work or where the project board (as the governing body) does not have the technical capability or understanding to make informed decisions or appropriately challenge the project teams, a model utilizing the expertise of external suppliers to assure the work and support decision-making may be chosen. The delivery model should support risk being allocated to the part of the organizational ecosystem most capable of managing the risk.\nScenario: example of a delivery model (NowByou example: professional project manager contracted to set foundations and build internal capability; other aspects delivered internally, except voluntary consultation.)\nTable 6.3 Example delivery model (Illustrates in-house vs. external and product vs. labour split for different work/skills in a project.)\n6.3.2.2 RACI chart\nAlthough PRINCE2 provides clarity on the roles, responsibilities, and relationships within the core project team, it can be useful to define the same for aspects of the wider project ecosystem using techniques such as a RACI chart. A RACI chart is a matrix of all the activities or decision-making authorities in the project that shows the people or roles involved. RACI stands for:\n● Responsible one or more people who perform the task\n● Accountable the single person who ‘owns’ the task\n● Consulted the people whose input is required for the task\n● Informed the people who are informed of progress or completion of the task.\nAs there are usually many different people involved in any task, and they have differing responsibilities, a RACI chart makes the relationships and the authorities explicit. The benefits of a RACI chart include:\n● clarity of ownership\n● clear responsibility for delivery\n● stronger teamwork\n● visual format that reduces confusion and ensures there are no gaps."

      "content": "Where projects require multiple organizations to work together, there is a need to consider how to bridge between the varied working practices and ways of governing across the organizations. There may be political aspects of the business to consider when defining the project’s organizational structure. These will have an impact on the commercial management approach and issues such as how risk and reward is allocated, in particular, the track record of the business in delivering projects and competing interests on issues such as competition for the same people and resources.\nThere are numerous ways to structure the project management team roles in a commercial customer-supplier context. The aim is to ensure that both organizations establish and maintain sound business justification for their work and that their individual governance is respected.\nExplored below are some commercial context considerations:\n● The project manager needs to have a good understanding of their obligations under any contract with the supplier organization. The project manager will normally come from the customer organization. The supplier’s staff may fulfil some of the team manager roles for the project, and they may even be called project managers in the supplier’s organization. Clarity is required regarding differences in job title compared to the title of their project role.\n● There may be projects where the project manager comes from the supplier’s organization. The customer may choose to stay at a distance from the working level and expect the supplier to provide the management of the project. The customer is likely to increase the rigour in project assurance and indeed may choose to appoint one of its own staff to fulfil the role of project assurance.\n● There may be a joint project board with representatives from the customer and all the suppliers that the customer has engaged. The project executive on this joint project board may be supplied by the customer, and the senior suppliers will represent each of the suppliers.\n● The supplier may treat their work packages within the customer’s project as a project within the supplier’s organization. This may mean establishing a separate supplier project board. The relationship between any such boards and the customer’s project board should be defined.\n● If there are multiple suppliers, all of them may be represented on the project board as it provides a forum for them to integrate direction and decision-making. However, if there are more than three or four suppliers, then it will be typically more effective for the contracts manager responsible for the performance of all the supplier contracts to sit on the project board on their behalf. Or it may be appropriate to appoint a prime contractor. The decision on whether to include external suppliers on the project board may be more of a cultural one based on the customer’s perception of the risk of divulging commercial or financial issues.\n● During procurement, the project may need a temporary appointment from within the customer organization (such as from its procurement team) for the senior supplier role until a supplier has been appointed.\nWhen the commercial management approach requires a significant change in the project team, it should detail how the commercial arrangements can support project team members through the transition points, such as fixed-term contracts aligned to stages.\nScenario: suppliers attending part of board meeting (LouisShopping example: BuildyBrick representatives attend project board for status updates and advice, separating internal business case discussions from design and delivery updates.)"

In some cases, a simple change of terminology and minor amendments to the role description will suffice. For example, iterative-incremental product development techniques often include the role of product owner, which could be aligned to the senior user role. In other cases, distinct roles may need to be added to the project management team structure along with agreement on how they relate to the PRINCE2 roles.\n● How will the project manager liaise with teams when they are using different delivery methods from each other (such as a hybrid of linear-sequential and iterative-incremental)?\n● If self-organizing delivery teams are used, how do they relate to the team manager role? Would the team manager role be held by a scrum master, held collectively by team members, or the responsibilities of team manager would be split between team members, product owner, and scrum master?\nThe use of management by exception is essential to enable the PRINCE2 method and iterative incremental techniques to work together in the most effective way. This empowers the project management team and enables it to self-organize within clearly defined boundaries.

To support this, there should be clear accountability for sustainability targets across the project ecosystem captured in the business case, the requirement setting, and people’s role descriptions.

The project approach should empower team members to deliver sustainably, embedding sustainability considerations into all decision-making and ensuring a diversity of perspectives to challenge the way things have always been done.\nThe project management team structure and role descriptions should define responsibilities for delivering the sustainability targets, including how they will be managed once the project is concluded.

On smaller, simpler projects, people working on the project may be assigned multiple roles, so long as the separation from the project manager to the project executive and project assurance is observed.\nAnother aspect of large, complex projects is that there is often a need for the project board to delegate authority to approve requests for change or off-specification, so they are not overwhelmed with requests or experience slow progress in responding to them.\nThe project board may choose to establish a change authority, distinct from the project manager, which reports to the project board.

In PRINCE2, there are the following types of plan: project plan, stage plan, team plan, and exception plan.\nThe development of a plan enables the project management team to assess and understand:\n● The why the user’s driving requirements and the benefits they expect to realize\n● The what the products to be delivered and their associated acceptance criteria and quality specifications\n● The how the delivery method and any constraints\n● The when the sequence and estimated duration of delivery activities\n● The where the locations and facilities involved in delivery and acceptance\n● The who the required skills and responsibilities of the project team and how they will be organized\n● The how much the estimated cost of the agreed products and the associated delivery and management activities.\nAdditionally, it will enable the project management team to assess and understand:\n● Any risks that may be encountered in the course of delivery\n● Any issues that affect the accuracy or realism of the plan.\nAn approved and baselined plan enables communication between the project management team and its stakeholders and within the members of the project team.\n7.1.2 Plans enable control\nPlans provide the backbone of the information required to manage a project. When approved, a plan provides a baseline against which progress can be measured and issues assessed. Without a plan, there is no point of reference against which scope, benefits, quality, risks, issues, and progress can be monitored and controlled.\nAn approved and baselined project plan represents the agreed scope of the project. A stage plan represents the scope of a stage, and a team plan, where used, represents the scope of work allocated to a specific team. A clear understanding of what is and what is not within the approved project scope is essential to avoid uncontrolled changes, which is often referred to as scope creep.\nDefinition: Scope\nThe sum of the product, delivery, and management activities represented by an approved plan and its product descriptions and work package descriptions."

      "content": "PRINCE2 provides a comprehensive approach to planning and a flexible set of plans. Planning considers all phases of the project lifecycle and all products and activities that occur within the project. Planning takes place continuously as all issues must to be considered in terms of impact upon the plan.\n7.2.1 Planning horizon\nPlans are always based on estimates. Estimates can become increasingly uncertain because of the length of a project, the type of products or delivery model, or how complex or dynamic the project environment is. For this reason, planning activities and plans should only cover a time period whereby it is possible to plan with reasonable confidence. This time period is called the planning horizon.\nThe planning horizon will impact the level of detail which can be planned. If the project plan has a long planning horizon it will be a high level plan; the stage plan has a shorter planning horizon and is a more detailed plan.\nIn a shorter planning horizon, more detail can be planned.\nPlans that extend beyond the planning horizon incorporate uncertainties that introduce their own risks to the project. For example, a plan that details what the day-by-day activities of team members will be a year or more in the future will almost certainly be inaccurate.\nThe PRINCE2 principle of manage by stages addresses the need to keep plans within reasonable planning horizons. For this reason, a PRINCE2 project has:\n● a project plan as a high-level description of how and when the project’s objectives are to be achieved and show the major products, activities, and required people and resources (It provides a baseline against which to monitor progress throughout the life of the project.)\n● a stage plan for the current stage as a detailed document, based on more precise estimates that are achievable within the planning horizon.\nScenario: illustrating a sensible planning horizon (LouisShopping example: combining planning horizons for the long-term project plan (two years remaining) and short-term stage plan (current design stage).)\nScenario: scope uncertainty and short planning horizon (Findef example: short stages/timeboxes of 1 month suggested due to high uncertainty and iterative-incremental approach, fixing time/cost and varying scope.)\n7.2.2 Levels of plans\nAll PRINCE2 plans have the same fundamental structure. What differs is the purpose, scope, and level of details. For example, a project plan, which covers the full project lifecycle, is less detailed than a stage plan that only covers a single stage. Whatever the type of plan, it should provide sufficient information for the project management team to be confident that it represents a realistic assessment of the products to be delivered and the work required to deliver them.\nFigure 7.1 Relationship between PRINCE2 plans\n7.2.2.1 Project plan\nDefinition: Project plan\nA high-level plan showing the major products of the project and when, how, and at what cost they will be delivered.\nThe purpose of the project plan is to provide confidence to the project board that the project will fulfil its business case. The project plan also informs the project management team that they have a viable approach to deliver the required products within the approved resources and tolerances.\nThe project plan should identify the number of stages and details of the stage boundaries, as well as proposed work packages into which the product delivery activities will be organized. These work packages typically represent the top level of the project’s work breakdown structure. The project plan should state whether each work package will be delivered sequentially or in an iterative-incremental manner. In an iterative-incremental project, some work packages may be detailed in a subsequent stage plan, but their general purpose and scope should be stated in the project plan.\nThe project plan is created during the process of initiating the project and baselined upon its approval by the project board. In the process of managing a stage boundary, any necessary changes to the project plan should be approved by the project board and reflected in an updated and baselined project plan.\n7.2.2.2 Stage plan\nDefinition: Stage plan\nA detailed plan used as the basis for project management control throughout a stage.\nA stage plan is prepared for each stage. The stage plan is similar to the project plan in structure, but each element is divided to the level of detail required for day-to-day control by the project manager.\nThe information provided in a stage plan should be traceable back to the project plan. An indicator that a project is at risk of scope creep is when activities or products in a stage plan cannot be linked to a high-level element of the project plan. A product breakdown structure for the stage, showing the products in scope and their relationships, should be included in each stage plan.\nA work breakdown structure for the stage, identifying the major activities to be performed during the stage and the people and resources involved in each of these activities, should also be included in each stage plan.\nThe stage plan for initiating a project is created during the process of starting up a project. Subsequent stage plans are prepared near the end of the current stage. This approach allows a stage plan to:\n● be produced close to the time when the planned activities will occur\n● exist for a much shorter duration than the project plan, accommodating the planning horizon\n● be produced with the knowledge of the performance of earlier stages.\nScenario: use of specialist involvement in stage plan creation (Findef example: marketing agency specialists involved in stage plan creation to ensure realistic estimates and appropriate risk management for new product development.)\n7.2.2.3 Team plan\nDefinition: Team plan\nA plan used as the basis for organizing and controlling the work of a team when executing a work package. Team plans are optional in PRINCE2.\nA team plan is produced by a team manager to facilitate the execution of one or more work packages. The need for these plans is determined by the size and complexity of the project and the nature of the resources involved. A team plan can be useful when the team is a temporary organization with staff from different parts of an organization.\n7.2.2.4 Exception plan\nDefinition: Exception plan\nA plan that follows an exception report and explains how the project will respond to the exception within the stage.\nWhen a project or stage exceeds (or is anticipated to exceed) an agreed tolerance, a project manager will raise an exception report to the project board. If the project board decides to address the exception within the stage, the project management team will prepare an exception plan that covers how directed actions will be performed.\nSubject to the magnitude of the exception plan’s impact, the exception plan may simply be limited to remediation actions such as more frequent inspections in response to a quality exception. If resolution of the exception requires actions beyond the scope of the current stage, those actions must be addressed through a change to the project plan.\nException plans are not required for team plans used to manage the delivery of work packages.\n7.2.3 Stages\nThe goal of the project plan is to give the project board and the project manager confidence in proceeding with delivery.\nPRINCE2 structures the management of the project on a stage-by-stage basis. Combined with the focus on products principle, managing by stages helps the project management team to plan and deliver what is required when it is required.\n7.2.3.1 The number of stages\nThe number of stages can vary, based on the nature of the products and the necessary delivery activities. A greater number of stages increases the degree of control, but every stage boundary requires effort to manage. Therefore, there is a trade-off between the degree of control and the level of management overhead on the project.\nFor a simple project with a small number of well-understood products and mature delivery method, only two stages may be required. These are an initiation stage to prepare the project initiation documentation and a single delivery stage.\nFor a larger project with a complex set of products and a mix of delivery methods, multiple delivery stages, each with their own products and stage boundaries, will be required. This approach allows the project management team to refine its estimates in each stage plan and the project board to confirm that the project is continuing to satisfy its business justification.\nFor an iterative-incremental project, the project plan may provide multiple delivery stages in which the quality and acceptance criteria are refined in parallel with development of the required products through the use of a product backlog.\nSome projects may need to align stage boundaries with external events. For example, in organizations with an annual budget cycle, there may be a requirement to provide an accounting of what the project has delivered and also what is in progress as it stands at the end of the budget year prior to authorization of the next portion of the project budget.\n7.2.3.2 The length of stages\nDetermining the appropriate length of a stage is a matter of assessing the following:\n● The level of complexity If the number and dependencies among delivery activities is high, a shorter stage may help avoid encountering exceptions to the approved tolerances.\n● The level of risk Stages are useful in providing control over high-risk projects. Stage breaks can be inserted at key points where risks to the project can be reviewed before major commitment of resources.\n● The planning horizon If there is significant uncertainty in the estimates of resources or of the duration of activities, a shorter stage can allow these estimates to be refined in the next stage plan.\n● Appropriate decision points Stage boundaries should be aligned with critical decisions to be made by the project board (such as whether and how to continue after delivery of a prototype) or business layer decisions or events (such as a business planning cycle).\n● Alignment with programme activities Programmes may be organized around groups of projects structured around distinct changes in capability and delivery tranches. The programme may require the project to align the end of a stage with the end of a programme tranche.\nThe length of stages does not have to be uniform throughout the project. The design or prototyping stages for a new system, for example, may be much shorter than the build stage.\n7.2.3.3 Stages and work packages\nPRINCE2 stages do not overlap. Instead, they partition the project by introducing stop-go decision points. By not overlapping, they enable the project management team and project board to review progress and assess whether the project has continued business justification and therefore should proceed to the next stage. The stages also enable the project management team and project board to maintain alignment with the business case through the plans for the subsequent stage and the decisions taken at stage boundaries.\nFigure 7.2 Illustration of stages and work packages\nProject work may be organized into logical groups of work packages, depending on the delivery method being used, the set of specialist skills required, or the relationships of the organizations involved. Such logical groupings of activity may run in parallel and overlap. It is a good practice to avoid having work packages that span a stage boundary, as decisions taken at stage boundaries could lead to repeated work or waste relating to work in progress. Where work packages span a stage boundary, such as work packages involving procurement of long lead items, their status will need to be reviewed as part of the process of managing a stage boundary.\n7.2.4 Tolerances in planning\nMany projects are driven by various constraints, such as schedules and resources. For example, a project that must be completed by a certain date would be considered a schedule-driven project. On the other hand, a project that must be delivered without any resources beyond those authorized in the project initiation documentation would be considered a resource-driven project. A crucial element of effective planning is understanding which constraints take precedence, to select which approaches to use, and the appropriate tolerances for control.\nPRINCE2 includes tolerances for benefits, time, cost, quality, scope, risks, and sustainability to manage such constraints at each level of the plan. The PRINCE2 technique for planning helps the project management team to set tolerances that balance the need for the project board to maintain effective control. At the same time, it enables the project manager or team manager to achieve efficient delivery.\nDefinition: Time tolerance\nThe permissible deviation in a plan’s time that is allowed before the deviation needs to be escalated to the next level of management.\nThe plan for a schedule-driven project will have a narrow time tolerance, possibly set to zero, indicating that any delays would put the project at risk of failure.\nDefinition: Cost tolerance\nThe permissible deviation in a plan’s cost that is allowed before it needs to be escalated to the next level of management.\nThe plan for a project that must be delivered within a fixed budget will have a narrow cost tolerance, possibly set to zero, indicating that there is no room for an increase in cost.\nDefinition: Scope tolerance\nThe permissible deviation in a plan’s scope that is allowed before it needs to be escalated to the next level of management.\nThe plan for a project delivering a product that is new to an organization might specify some level of tolerance for initial support and user training after acceptance. This is to ensure a smooth transition to the new business as usual.\nHow wide or narrow each tolerance is set for each level of plan improves the understanding of which constraints take precedence and how they should be incorporated into a plan.\nScenario: tolerances changing from stage to stage (LouisShopping example: tolerances tightened from +/- 40% to +/- 20% after initiation stage completion, reflecting reduced uncertainty.)\n7.2.5 Product-based planning\nDefinition: Product-based planning\nThe PRINCE2 technique leads to a plan based on the creation and delivery of the required products.\nFocus on products is a principle of PRINCE2. This means that planning in PRINCE2 focuses on identifying the required products first and then determining the most effective way to deliver them. Users tend to care most about the outputs they expect from a project, so a focus on products helps the project management team avoid activities that do not contribute in a substantive way to the required outputs.\nThe focus on products also helps the project manager know where to start when developing plans. When the products required from the project are understood, it becomes easier to determine the project approach, the necessary people and resources, realistic timelines, and the likely risks and issues.\nBy clearly and consistently identifying and documenting the products to be produced by the plan and the interdependencies between them, product-based planning reduces the risk of scope being neglected or overlooked. It also helps establish agreement on one aspect crucial to ensuring project success, which is a clear definition of what is and what is not within the project’s scope.\nProduct-based planning simplifies the identification of the work packages and the sequencing of these work packages. This advantage continues into subordinate plans, such as stage plans and team plans. Finally, if the project encounters exceptions, product-based planning helps exception plans focus on resolving the exception with minimal impact on cost and schedule."

      "content": "PRINCE2 includes a planning technique based on product-based planning shown in figure 7.3. An alternative planning procedure can be used in its place if desired, for example, if the business has already developed a procedure specific to their organization. The use of an alternative procedure should be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nProduct-based planning takes the definition and analysis of the required products as the starting point for planning and deriving any supporting elements of the plan from these product descriptions, such as the work breakdown structure, estimates, and project schedule.\nThe planning technique is not strictly sequential. For example, scheduling and estimating are often interdependent and performed in a collaborative manner. On the other hand, the preparation of the budget is usually more efficient when the product descriptions, work package descriptions, and schedule are relatively mature.\nFigure 7.3 The PRINCE2 planning technique\nThe technique for preparing a plan covers all types of plan: the project plan, stage plans, team plans, and exception plans. The project management team or team manager should focus on the products associated with each plan and determine the necessary activities and resources, prepare a realistic schedule, and analyse the associated risks.\nStage plans and team plans are more limited in scope than the project plan but may be more detailed. For example, the schedule in a project plan may represent the project’s timeline at the month or week level. Yet, a stage plan may detail the work to be performed at the level of days. In the same way, a project plan may identify required people by skillset, yet a team manager may identify these people by name in a team plan.\nIn preparing subordinate plans, the project management team or team manager must ensure not to introduce requirements or activities that cannot be traced back to the approved project plan. This is because it is a common means by which uncontrolled changes in scope, known as scope creep, are introduced.\n7.3.2 Defining and analysing the products\nDefining and analysing products comprises four steps as illustrated in figure 7.4.\nFigure 7.4 Defining and analysing products\n7.3.2.1 Writing the project product description\nThe project requirements are defined and analysed in two progressive levels of detail.\nIn the process of starting up a project, the major products or outcomes, along with key quality requirements, are documented in the project product description. The aim of this step is to confirm that all the major products needed to achieve the user’s expected outcomes are identified. It is important to assess and confirm that no necessary products have been missed, and no unnecessary products have been included.\nDefinition: Project product description\nA description of the project’s major products or outcomes, including the user’s quality expectations, together with the acceptance criteria and acceptance methods for the project.\nIt is recommended that high-level acceptance criteria be stated in objectively measurable terms. However, this may not always be feasible. Therefore, a set of descriptive statements may be used as long as the project brief clearly indicates that these statements will be translated into more precise criteria as part of developing the product descriptions. This is important not only for reaching a common understanding between the project manager and project board but also to enable an effective set of quality tolerances to be established.\nAlternative solutions and project approaches may be considered to ensure the approach and products most likely to satisfy the business case are included in the project scope. They are likely to be described in high-level detail only.\n7.3.2.2 Creating a product breakdown structure\nDefinition: Product breakdown structure\nA hierarchy of all the products to be produced during a plan.\nA product breakdown structure is useful for describing the products to be delivered and their essential components. Each product is divided into its component elements in a hierarchical manner, and the requirements for those elements are collected.\nFigure 7.5 Product breakdown structure for LouisShopping project (Example of breaking down the shopping mall product into sub-products like enabling works, mall tenants, and operational readiness.)\nA function of a product breakdown structure is to allow requirements specific to one product or component to be grouped together in a logical manner. For instance, in the example of a house, the requirements for the plumbing are closely interrelated, whereas the requirements for wall finishings are largely independent of those for the plumbing.\nAnother function of a product breakdown structure is to group requirements related to the same procurement or delivery method. In the house example, the land is likely purchased in a different way and from a different source than the construction of the house.\nIt may be worth considering whether to include different states of a particular product. For example, the mall may start as a design from an architect, then become a construction effort by a construction team, and then a decorator for the interior finishing. Although the owner’s goal is to obtain a building with units which can be let to tenants, there may be quality specifications for each state.\n7.3.2.3 Writing product descriptions\nIn the process of initiating a project, the required products are described in more detail. The project manager elicits the user’s requirements for these products and documents them in one or more product descriptions. The project manager also consults with subject matter experts to determine requirements related to how these products are procured, developed, tested, used, and supported after acceptance. The aim of this more detailed step is to confirm that the requirements for the major products have been described in sufficient detail to enable realistic scheduling and estimation.\nThe definition and analysis of products may be an iterative procedure. In a linear-sequential project, the product descriptions should be sufficiently detailed to enable costs and time to be estimated at an appropriate level of confidence. However, in an iterative-incremental project, the detailed requirements for products may be developed in parallel with the products themselves, and a high-level set of product descriptions may be sufficient to proceed with the stage in which they are to be developed.\nProjects rarely have the luxury of fulfilling all user expectations without regard to constraints. For example, a desirable product option that has a high energy demand may be in conflict with sustainability constraints set for the project. For this reason, it is helpful to prioritize quality specifications for each product to ensure that the most important requirements are met.\n7.3.2.4 Creating a product flow diagram\nDefinition: Product flow diagram\nA diagram showing the sequence of production and interdependencies of the products listed in a product breakdown structure.\nThe development of the product breakdown structure helps to identify dependencies among the products. These dependencies can be described in a product flow diagram, which illustrates the sequence in which the products in the plan will be developed and any dependencies between them.\nIn some cases, intermediate products will need to be delivered. Intermediate products are products that are created as an essential input to the delivery of another product but not intended for use by the user. For example, producing a prototype can be an effective way to reduce the risk of full-scale production, but the prototype itself is only the input to the full-scale production stage. The product flow diagram and product breakdown structure must include both intermediate and final products, as well as any dependencies on external products outside the scope of the plan.\nFigure 7.6 Product flow diagram for LouisShopping project (Visual representation of product sequence for the shopping mall project.)\nA product flow diagram should have a clear starting point and a clear end point. Its level of detail should be appropriate to the cost, duration, and scale of the products and work involved. Preparing the product flow diagram usually involves consultation with subject matter experts in the delivery and acceptance of the required products.\nThe project manager and senior user may find it useful to use the product breakdown structure and product flow diagram to identify when project outputs (the products) will begin to affect outcomes and to allow the user to begin to measure the realization of benefits. It may also be useful to distinguish products by which stage they are completed in, for example by colour.\n7.3.2.5 Organizing work packages\nThe product flow diagram helps the project management team decide whether the project should be delivered in a linear-sequential or iterative-incremental manner.\nWhen the delivery method is decided, the delivery activities involved in each product can be identified and organized into work packages. Each work package should combine closely related people, resources, and delivery activities. Also, each should create at least one required end product or an intermediate product required as an input to a subsequent work package.\nIf a work package depends on delivery of a product from another work package or from an activity outside the scope of the project, this relationship is considered a dependency.\nDefinition: Dependency\nA dependency means that one product is dependent on another. There are at least two types of dependency relevant to a project: internal and external.\nInternal dependency An internal dependency is one between two products of a project. In these circumstances, the project team has control over the dependency.\nExternal dependency An external dependency is one between a project product and a product or activity outside the scope of the project. In these circumstances, the project team does not have complete control over the dependency.\nAll dependencies shown in the product flow diagram must be documented in the associated work package description. Regardless of whether a contract is involved in the delivery of a work package (for example, there may not be a contract for an internal supplier), a work package description is considered an agreement between the project manager and the team manager responsible for the work package.\nAlthough work packages are often interrelated, the project manager should ensure there is no overlap in the scope of any two work packages. This could incur unnecessary costs and create potential conflicts between teams. The totality of the work packages should comprise the full delivery scope of the project. There should be no gaps between the product flow diagram, the product breakdown structure, and the full set of work packages.\nIt can be useful to organize project management activities into a single work package for each stage, even if these activities are not considered part of the project budget. This helps document all project management tasks and to show the relationship between stages and milestones and activities purely in relation to product delivery.\nIn the PRINCE2 planning technique, the work breakdown structure (see Chapter 6) is a technique with several applications. It is used to support project organization by mapping work packages to the teams or suppliers responsible for delivering the associated products. This application is particularly helpful when a project has a mix of work packages, with one or more being delivered through internal staff and others by external suppliers. Where people represent a major element of the project’s costs, the work breakdown structure allows labour costs to be described in terms of types of skills, level of effort, and duration of effort.\nFinally, the work breakdown structure helps in developing team plans, where necessary work to deliver the products can be detailed in terms of tasks and the team members assigned to them. The work breakdown structure is optional for simple projects with one or two products or work packages and small delivery teams.\n7.3.2.6 Preparing estimates\nProject managers and team managers always plan using estimates of:\n● People These can be the specific skills required, the level of effort involved, and when and where they will be needed.\n● Resources These can be specific materials, equipment, facilities, access, natural resources, or money, as well as the number or amount of each.\n● Duration of activities Preparation of the schedule requires estimating the time it is likely to take to complete tasks.\n● Cost of people and resources For people, these can be labour rates, fees, or salaries, whereas for resources such as materials, these can be unit costs and based on market rates or supplier contracts.\n● Benefits These can be estimates of the value of the outcomes enabled by the project products.\n● Risk These can be estimates of the proximity, probability, velocity, and the impact of risks and their associated risk responses.\nIt is useful to include a level of confidence with every estimate. The higher the level of confidence in an estimate, the less likely that unexpected variations will be encountered during delivery. This enables the project manager and project board to agree to a realistic set of tolerances.\nExamples of estimating techniques are provided in section 7.3.4.\n7.3.2.7 Preparing a schedule\nDefinition: Schedule\nA graphical representation of a plan (such as a Gantt chart), typically describing a sequence of tasks together with resource allocations, which collectively deliver the plan.\nThe sequencing, interrelationships, and duration of work packages and their associated tasks are captured in a schedule. All work packages for a stage must be included in the schedule for the stage.\nA work package includes one or more delivery activities. These activities, in turn, can be decomposed into a set of tasks. For each task, the people and resources can be identified. Then, the level of effort required and the duration of each task can be estimated.\nThe project manager should consider the planning horizon and use stage plans to elaborate the schedule as the level of effort and duration of tasks are better understood.\nThe schedule should identify the amount of time that an activity can be delayed without affecting the completion time of the plan. This is known as float or slack. A schedule with zero float across all activities represents a high risk of delay and exception to the time tolerance.\nA critical path diagram illustrates the sequence of activities from the start to the end of the project that have the least amount of total float. Any delay beyond the planned float between any two activities on the critical path means the project will overrun its schedule.\nA weakness in the critical path diagram is that it does not address resource limitations. Therefore, it may be useful to identify the critical chain as well. The critical chain is the sequence of tasks that, given available resources, prevents a project from being completed in a shorter time given. In the example of the house project, the critical chain might reflect the fact that local regulations prohibit outside construction work on weekends.\nBy identifying schedule constraints, the project manager is able to focus on changes in the schedule of activities, critical path, or critical chain as potential exceptions. Moreover, the project manager can avoid exceptions by adjusting the timing of activities with the available float or resource flexibilities.\n7.3.4 Estimating\nA variety of estimating techniques are available to project managers. These include the following:\n● Top-down A top-down technique assumes that the costs, duration, and level of effort of the major products and work packages can be estimated to a high-level of confidence. These are then allocated to subordinate elements of the product breakdown structure and work breakdown structure. This technique could be used for an iterative-incremental project in which delivery is structured into stages and sprints with fixed timeframes and resources.\n● Bottom-up A bottom-up technique develops estimates for individual products, components, activities, or tasks at their lowest level of definition. The lower-level estimates are then aggregated to obtain overall estimates. This technique is useful when the lower-level elements are well-understood but will be combined in a manner unique to the project or new to the organization.\n● Comparative When the materials, products, or delivery work are well-understood and based on common practices, estimates can be developed based on similar projects or openly available market information.\n● Parametric When measured or when empirical data on materials, effort, and duration is available and supported by estimating models (such as in the construction industry), estimates can be developed using values from the project, such as the number, units, or size of a structure.\n● Data analytics Descriptive analytics (understanding the characteristics of a task) and predictive analytics (understanding a task’s predisposition to particular outcomes) can be used to help improve estimates. This will require access to data that may be generated by the project, held by the business layer, or sourced from a data trust.\n● Subject matter expertise Consensus-based techniques, such as Delphi and planning poker, can be used to develop a consensus on estimates with the participation of subject matter experts.\nSeveral estimating techniques are often used in large and complex projects. The project manager may seek support from specialists in cost estimation if they are available to the project."

      "content": "For projects in a commercial context, the role of suppliers is an important consideration. Many projects rely on external suppliers to deliver work packages. This is one reason why it is useful to align work packages with their responsible suppliers, whether external or internal. However, when an external supplier is responsible for a work package, this arrangement may be reflected through a formal agreement such as a contract.\nIt is recommended to ensure that the agreement requires the supplier’s plans to provide clear traceability to the applicable elements of the user’s project plan. The agreement should require alignment with the acceptance criteria and quality specifications approved by the project board. This approach is often referred to as a back-to-back agreement.\nThe agreement should state how these plans are to be produced and what rights of inspection and audit the user has. The supplier’s plan should have sufficient activities or milestones for the user’s project manager to maintain their plans.\nBoth the user’s and supplier’s plans may be confidential to the other party as they may contain other information, such as dependencies to or from other client projects or subcontractor costs. Therefore, it is beneficial to prepare non-confidential versions of the plan that can be shared while omitting private information.\nPlans need to include procurement-related milestones such as purchase orders and milestone payments aligned with each stage.\nScenario: procurement/tender in separate stages (Findef example: procurement for advisory, marketing, and training services completed in Stage 2 before the detailed design stages, using a hybrid approach and weighted criteria for selection.)"

      "content": "The PRINCE2 planning techniques can be applied in both linear-sequential and iterative-incremental projects. For linear-sequential projects, most planning effort is applied upfront in the processes of starting up a project and initiating a project. This is because these projects are often characterized by well-understood products and mature delivery activities. The example of similar projects helps establish the planning horizon and suggest the necessary products, work packages, and stages. Duration, level of effort, and costs can be estimated with a high level of confidence. The estimates in the project plan are refined in stage plans, and team plans and product descriptions are further detailed in subsequent stages, but the project plan usually does not change unless there is a project level exception.\nOn the other hand, iterative-incremental projects focus on how much can be produced over a fixed period of time (such as a sprint or a timebox). This is with the goal of delivering an initial product quickly and refining and improving it iteratively.\nWhen an iterative-incremental approach such as agile is being used, a common planning approach would consist of:\n● setting tolerances for each iteration that effectively fix time and cost and enable more flexibility in scope\n● producing the project product description in terms of expected outcomes and benefits\n● developing the user stories, epics, and product backlogs instead of product descriptions\n● determining the length of releases or timeboxes and defining these as stages\n● estimating the resource requirements for each stage and preparing the project budget\n● combining the product backlog and workflow in a collaborative planning tool, such as a Kanban board. A Kanban board may be used instead of a team plan and is developed as a joint effort by the whole development team.\nThe iterative-incremental approach lends itself to the review and update of the plan as part of each cycle, just as in the preparation of stage plans in a linear project. However, it reflects the updates in a collaborative planning tool.\nScenario: timebox delivery method (Data Knowledge example: 2-week timeboxes used for iterative-incremental delivery of time-recording solution to ensure continuous and early value perception.)"

      "content": "Plans can address sustainability in at least three different ways:\n● Product sustainability In identifying and describing the required products, it is useful to determine the environmental impact of the product through its full lifecycle, including disposal where appropriate.\n● Delivery sustainability Projects often face choices in planning work packages and stages that can affect the climate impacts of the delivery activities. Agreeing to sustainability tolerances is an effective way in which the project manager and project board can keep things like fuel consumption and production wastes aligned with the organizational strategy.\n● Benefits sustainability Projects often deliver benefits long after they have been closed. Projects also sometimes fail to achieve the expected benefits because there are only limited means to sustain these benefits. For example, ongoing training and user support are not considered when defining the project’s scope. An effective way to avoid this problem is by identifying requirements to ensure benefits sustainability."

      "content": "The PRINCE2 planning technique supports a wide range of projects. Although product-based planning always applies, the level of effort involved in planning can easily be scaled up or down based on the characteristics and needs of the project.\nAspects of project scale that affect planning include:\n● Duration The longer a project’s lifecycle, the more likely that project plans will need to adapt to changes in both the external environment and internal project delivery activities. Duration should be considered in organizing work packages and stages, as well as in estimating the change budget. In addition, multi-year projects will likely see changes in the project team, including key roles such as the project manager. Project plans should be prepared to aid orientation, continuity, and reduce the impact of turnover.\n● Size of the project team Large and dispersed project teams will generally need more project support and benefit from easily accessible project planning and reporting tools and documentation.\n● Complexity Projects with a small number of products and work packages can be planned with relatively simple documents and tools. For example, the project schedule could be a list of major milestones or a presentation slide. However, as the number of products and work packages increase, the use of specialized tools such as a project scheduling application will make it much easier to analyse and incorporate changes.\n● Novelty If the products or delivery method are new to an organization, it may be difficult to rely on experience or similar projects to capture requirements or estimate schedule and costs. Therefore, plans incorporate a high degree of uncertainty and the use of risk mitigating techniques (such as prototyping) or an iterative-incremental approach may be justified.\n● Cost Project planning is one of the most prudent ways to reduce the risk of project failure. Therefore, it is sensible to ensure that the level of effort in project planning is in line with the overall cost of the project. The cost of project planning and support will depend on the importance and complexity of the project. In some cases, it could be ten percent or more of the overall cost of the project.\nScenario: contrasting scale (LouisShopping (long, complex) requires a combination of high-level and detailed planning; NowByou (simple, short) requires only a single timeframe plan.)"

These terms are:\n● user’s quality expectations\n● requirements\n● acceptance criteria\n● quality specifications.\nDefinition: User’s quality expectations\nA statement about the quality expected from the project product, captured in the project product description.\nAll project stakeholders have expectations of how the project will be performed and of the products it will deliver. However, in PRINCE2, the term user’s quality expectations only applies to the statements found in the project product description.\nDefinition: Requirement\nA need or expectation that is documented in an approved management product.\nSimilarly, the PRINCE2 method distinguishes between needs and expectations that are captured in an approved management product (such as a product description) and those that are not. Captured and documented needs or expectations are considered requirements, which constitute part of the project scope. Needs and expectations that are not captured in an approved management product are not part of the project scope. This distinction is essential to enable effective monitoring and control.\nDefinition: Acceptance criteria\nA prioritized list of criteria that the project product must meet before the user will accept it. For example, measurable definitions of the attributes required for the set of products to be acceptable to key stakeholders.\nAcceptance criteria are stated in the project product description. In effect, they are owned by the business, and the project board approves these on behalf of the business. Acceptance criteria are typically described in terms of the functional capabilities the business expects to achieve upon the acceptance of the project products.\nDefinition: Quality specifications\nA description of the quality measures that will be applied by those performing quality control and the levels that a finished product must meet.\nQuality specifications are stated in product descriptions. These are typically both derived from the user’s quality expectations and determined by aspects of the business or operational context. Operational context could include applicable regulatory requirements or requirements driven by existing policies and practices."

      "content": "The principle of focusing on products is central to the PRINCE2 approach to quality. PRINCE2 uses the term requirements to describe the expectations, needs, and desires of a project’s stakeholders for the project products, outcomes, and benefits. No project can ever satisfy all requirements. This is why requirements need to be prioritized and agreed in a controlled manner.\nPRINCE2 provides a product-based approach to requirements that aims to translate requirements into acceptance criteria and quality specifications for project products and the activities to deliver them. This helps avoid expending resources on work that cannot be traced back to the project’s business justification.\nThe product-based quality management approach ensures clear traceability of quality specifications and quality controls to the required products, thereby avoiding conflicts over unmet user quality expectations.\nThe larger the scope and duration of a project, the larger (and more dynamic) the set of requirements the project manager will need to handle. No matter how thoroughly and accurately stakeholder requirements have been captured in product descriptions in the process of initiating a project, the project management team should anticipate requirements changes and be prepared to handle them. Requirements management is an ongoing activity that constitutes the first part of the product-based quality management approach.\nIt is easier and cheaper to correct quality issues and flaws early in the project lifecycle, rather than when the finished product is being tested or, worse, when the product is already in operational use. Prevention of such issues is achieved through quality planning, which also reduces the resources and risks involved in quality control."

      "content": "Quality management focuses on three elements: quality planning, quality control, and quality assurance.\n● Quality planning involves:\n● identifying the major products of the project and documenting them in terms of user’s quality expectations and acceptance criteria in the project product description\n● eliciting user requirements and detailing them in terms of quality specifications in product descriptions\n● developing the quality management approach to ensure the associated quality specifications and acceptance criteria are met\n● obtaining the project board’s approval for the above as a baseline for subsequent management and control.\n● Quality control involves:\n● implementing the agreed quality management approach during delivery\n● assessing issues related to quality and raising quality exceptions when necessary\n● obtaining acceptance of the delivered products.\n● Quality assurance involves:\n● ensuring that the quality planning and control techniques are sufficient to confirm that the quality requirements can be met.\n8.2.1 Quality planning\nDefinition: Quality planning\nThe capturing of quality specifications for the project products and generating the associated product descriptions and quality management approach.\n8.2.1.1 User’s quality expectations\nQuality planning begins with documenting the user’s quality expectations in the process of starting up a project. These expectations are described in the project product description, which is an element of the project brief.\nAlthough the project product description is often written at a high level, it should identify:\n● all the major products to be delivered\n● user quality expectations and acceptance criteria\n● any standards and procedures that will need to be applied, including the extent to which the business’, user’s, and supplier’s quality management systems should be used\n● any measurements that may be useful to assess whether the project product is acceptable\n● quality tolerances that may apply for the acceptance criteria.\nThis coverage is crucial to avoid the introduction of requirements outside the approved scope of the project in developing product descriptions.\n8.2.1.2 Quality tolerances\nDefinition: Quality tolerance\nThe permissible deviation in a product’s quality that is allowed before the deviation needs to be escalated to the next level of management.\nProjects rarely have sufficient resources to meet all quality specifications and acceptance criteria. Therefore, the project manager should work with stakeholders and the project board to develop and agree to a prioritization of these criteria using techniques such as those described in section 8.3. The prioritized acceptance and quality specifications can then be used to set quality tolerances by which the management and direction of the project can be exercised in line with the manage by exception principle.\n8.2.1.3 Describing products\nThe high-level requirements captured in the project product description are useful for management and direction purposes. However, the delivery of the products requires more detail to enable realistic planning, estimating, scheduling, and quality control.\nDefinition: Product description\nA description of a product’s purpose, format, composition, where it is derived from, quality specifications, and development responsibilities.\nThe requirements for a product are captured in a product description. It is produced when the need for the product is identified. In linear-sequential projects, this is often performed during the initiation stage and then at stage boundaries for each subsequent stage. However, in iterative-incremental projects, product descriptions evolve in parallel with product development work. This allows the product’s quality specifications to be refined through feedback from use of prototypes or early versions of the product.\nAfter acceptance, products become part of business as usual. Therefore, the needs of the staff responsible for operating and maintaining the products should be captured as quality specifications and included in the product descriptions.\nDefinition: Product register\nA component of the project log that identifies the products to be delivered by the project and records their acceptance.\n8.2.1.4 Product sustainability\nProduct descriptions should include product sustainability requirements captured as quality specifications or acceptance criteria. Product sustainability considers both the environmental impact of the product and the characteristics that will ensure that the product can sustain the realization of its benefits over its expected lifetime. It may be appropriate to consider how a product will be decommissioned if that work represents a significant portion of its overall environmental impact.\n8.2.1.5 Quality responsibilities\nTo avoid confusion and potential conflicts, the quality responsibilities for a product should be specified in the product description. Quality responsibilities are often described as the following:\n● Producer The person or group responsible for developing a product.\n● Reviewer The person or group responsible for assessing if a product meets its quality or acceptance criteria\n● reviewers should always be independent of producers to avoid a conflict of interest.\n● Acceptance authority The person or group responsible for deciding if a product is acceptable\n● this can be the project board, but the board may delegate the acceptance authority for some products\n● such delegation should be stated in the quality management approach.\n8.2.1.6 Quality in subordinate plans\nIndividual quality control events, such as testing, may be documented in further detail in stage and team plans to allow more accurate estimating and scheduling. However, project managers should take care not to introduce new requirements that cannot be traced back to the product descriptions and project product description. Changes to the baseline project initiation documentation arising from lower-level planning should be addressed using the issue management approach (see Chapter 10).\n8.2.2 Quality control\nDefinition: Quality control\nThe procedures to monitor the specific products of a project and their development or delivery activities to determine whether they comply with relevant standards and of identifying ways to minimize causes of unsatisfactory performance.\nProject quality control is a series of activities for each product usually involving a number of techniques. It begins when a product description is approved and recorded in the product register.\nIf the product is new and development or delivery includes new design or production methods, then quality control may involve evaluating both a prototype of the product and its initial production method ahead of full-scale production. If the product is mature or commercial off-the-shelf, quality control may simply consist of inspection at the point of delivery.\nThe quality techniques that will be applied to monitor and control product quality during delivery are described in the quality management approach.\nDefinition: Quality register\nA component of the project log that identifies all the quality control activities that are planned or have occurred and provides information for end stage reports and the end project report.\nThe quality register provides a record of quality control activities, starting with the approval of each product description. As the project progresses and records of the quality control activities are completed, the quality register is updated to reflect (in summary form) the actual results from the quality activities. The quality register provides key audit and assurance information, comparing what was planned and agreed (in the quality management approach and product descriptions) to the quality control activities actually performed.\nQuality control during delivery usually involves collaboration between the project manager, project assurance roles, and subject matter experts, whether internal or external. Quality control activities that require support from specialists within the business or external specialists should be included in the work breakdown structure, schedule, and project budget as described in section 8.3.\nScenario: responsibilities for quality control in quality management approach (LouisShopping example: Quality register for test parking plan and water pump illustrates producer, reviewer, approver, and results, including a failed performance test and successful subsequent maintenance test.)\nIf a product cannot pass a quality control activity, the failure must be reviewed against quality tolerances and quality specifications. Exceptions to quality tolerances and off-specifications are addressed using the issue management technique as described in Chapter 10.\nLessons identified in the course of the product quality lifecycle are captured in the project log: lessons log.\n8.2.3 Quality assurance\nDefinition: Quality assurance\nA planned and systematic activity that provides confidence that products will meet their defined quality specifications when tested under quality control. Quality assurance activities are typically performed by the business ensuring they are independent of the project team.\nQuality assurance focuses on ensuring that the project’s quality control measures are appropriate to assess the project products against their quality specifications. Quality assurance activities should take place throughout the project lifecycle, from start-up to closing.\nIt is important not to confuse quality assurance with project assurance. Quality assurance is focused on products and is independent of the project management team. It is typically performed by a function from the business. Project assurance is the responsibility of the project board and is used to confirm if the project is being conducted correctly. Project assurance is independent of the project manager but not the project."

The use of an alternative procedure should be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nFigure 8.1 Product quality lifecycle\n8.3.2 Supporting techniques\nAn understanding of the types of quality techniques used and their timing, location, and resource requirements is essential to project planning. Although a wide range of quality techniques exist, the most commonly used in a project context are:\n● Verification: focuses on confirming that the interim products reflect the necessary quality specifications and acceptance criteria; occurs during design and development before the actual product exists; usually requires support by specialists.\n● Validation: focuses on confirming that the product meets the quality specifications and acceptance criteria; occurs during testing or after the product exists; usually requires support by specialists and may require independent testing.\n● Prototyping: produces an interim product to obtain early feedback on functionality or to understand full scale production concerns; integral to iterative-incremental delivery (e.g., Agile); may involve comparing alternate versions (A/B testing).\n● Testing: involves use of the product or components under intended conditions; can occur at multiple times and locations (e.g., supplier facility, user location); live testing may be required for operational fit.\n● Inspection: confirms product compliance with quality specifications and acceptance criteria; usually occurs at delivery point; most applicable to commodities and commercial off-the-shelf products.\n● Certification: presentation of proof that the product or supplier complies with applicable industry or regulatory requirements; usually occurs at delivery point; requires lowest level of effort; only applicable to commercial off-the-shelf products.\nScenario: example quality standards (LouisShopping example: project needs to meet fire, safety, security, and heritage regulations; uses Mall Federation standards for construction and specialized testing for compliance.)"

Acceptance of a product from a supplier may be a prerequisite to acceptance of a product by the customer.

This enables product descriptions and quality specifications to be developed in sufficient detail to support scheduling and estimation to a higher level of confidence. However, this does not mean that there will be no changes in requirements in the course of production or delivery. Instead, the sequence of delivery activities is typically designed to allow uncertain aspects of product requirements and quality specifications to be addressed early, thereby reducing the level of risk in later stages.\nIn addition, as with all projects, acceptance criteria and quality specifications may be affected by changes external to a linear-sequential project and addressed through change control. An example of such an external change would be the introduction of new regulatory requirements for a project product.\nScenario: example of changes to scope and quality (Findef example: early market testing identified demand for a push notification feature and a new regulatory reporting requirement, leading to assessing impacts on scope and quality standards via change requests.)\n8.4.3.2 Iterative-incremental projects\nIn iterative-incremental projects, the quality specifications and acceptance criteria are not fixed with the approval of the project initiation documentation. Instead, they are considered goals that are to be achieved through iterations of development and delivery, often referred to as sprints.\nIn this case, the project product descriptions may be written in the form of high-level user stories with associated acceptance criteria and can develop iteratively as the project proceeds. As an alternative, the requirements (including quality specifications and acceptance criteria) can be captured and managed in a product backlog. This is a prioritized list that is reviewed and updated with each iteration. Acceptance criteria are commonly used to ascertain whether a user story has been completed.\nAn agile project may also aim for early delivery of a minimum viable product, a version of the product with just enough features to be usable for the purpose of providing feedback and refining requirements. Developing a product description for the minimum viable product is an effective way of demonstrating PRINCE2 principles with agile delivery. The quality management approach may include a standard ‘definition of done’ and ‘definition of ready’.\nScenario: timebox example (Data Knowledge example: Time-recording solution delivered in timeboxes, prioritizing must-have features in timebox three, with refinements covered in timebox four.)"

      "content": "Key message: The purpose of the risk practice is to identify, assess, and control uncertainties that would affect the project’s objectives, and, as a result, improve the ability of the project to succeed.\nAll projects encounter uncertainty when trying to achieve their objectives. This uncertainty may arise from events inside or outside the business. For example, there may be uncertainty from within the business about the ability to agree to the scope of the project within certain timescales, or the availability of key people and critical resources. There may also be uncertainty from outside the business, such as geopolitical events, economic conditions, changes to legislation, or suppliers’ responses to procurement requests coming within expected costs.\nDefinition: Risk\nAn uncertain event or set of events that, should they occur, will affect the achievement of objectives. A risk is measured by a combination of the probability of a perceived threat or opportunity occurring and the magnitude of its impact on objectives.\nRisks can have a negative or positive impact on objectives if they occur. PRINCE2 uses the terms ‘threat’ for uncertain events that would have a negative impact on objectives and ‘opportunity’ for uncertain events that would have a positive impact on objectives.\nThreats and opportunities can impact the project’s objective of delivering an agreed scope and benefits to an agreed time, cost, and quality, as well as within agreed sustainability targets.\nAs all projects involve some degree of risk-taking, they need to manage risk in a way that supports effective decision-making. The risk practice provides a disciplined environment for proactive decision-making.\nThe approach used by PRINCE2 to manage risk is aligned with the ISO standard, ISO 31000. This is the international standard for risk management. By providing comprehensive principles and guidelines, this standard helps organizations with their risk analysis and risk assessments. PRINCE2 risk approach is also aligned with regional variants of the ISO standard and can be tailored to meet these local requirements."

Techniques such as PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, and environmental) analysis and SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis (both described later in this chapter) can be used to analyse the internal and external context for risks. These techniques also help to identify different types of risk that may affect the project (for example, sustainability, cybersecurity, or systems integration). An understanding of the types of risks can also help to identify the most appropriate owners.\nA key item that needs to be recorded in the risk management approach is the project board’s attitude towards risk-taking, documented as the risk tolerance. The risk tolerance will be set by the project board based on the business’ overall risk appetite.\nAn important aspect of identifying risks is the ability to provide a clear and unambiguous expression of each risk. A useful way of expressing risk is to consider the following aspects:\n● Risk cause This should describe the source of the risk, such as the event or situation that causes it. These are often referred to as risk drivers. They are not risks in themselves but are potential trigger points for risk. These may be either internal or external to the project.\n● Risk event This should describe the area of uncertainty in terms of the threat or the opportunity.\n● Risk effect This should describe the impact that the risk would have on the project objectives, should the risk materialize.\nThe cause, event, and effect relationship could also be expressed as follows:\n● Threat Insufficient staffing capacity (risk cause) could lead to the business being unable to provide enough staff to complete user training in the planned timescales (risk event), resulting in the project taking longer than planned (risk effect).\n● Opportunity If allowable under data regulations, the company could include a discount code in the email (risk event) when it renews customer details every year (risk cause), generating income to offset the cost of the regulatory requirement (risk effect)."

Qualitative analysis of a risk includes, as a minimum, assessing its probability (the chance that the risk will occur) and its impact (the size of the effect on one or more objectives if the risk occurs). Other qualitative assessments include analysing a risk’s proximity (how near in time it might occur) and velocity (how quickly it would have an impact on objectives should it occur).\nA useful way of summarizing the set of risks and their estimations is to plot them onto a risk matrix, an example of which is shown in figure 9.1. This represents a situation at a specific point in time (such as a snapshot of the risk environment). The numbered markers in the matrix represent unique risk identifiers used in the risk register on which this is based. The risks above and to the right of the dashed risk tolerance line represent those that the business will not tolerate, except under special circumstances. In the depicted case, the project manager would refer risks 1, 3, and 4 to the project board.\nFigure 9.1 Risk matrix\nThe risk matrix can also be used to show trends. For example, risk 6 may have previously been recorded as ‘low probability, high impact’, indicating that its probability of occurring is increasing.\nIt is also possible to take a quantitative approach to prioritize risks. Quantitative risk assessment (for example, Monte Carlo analysis) involves using modelling techniques to calculate levels of overall risk exposure and analyse the effects of risk. Risk models use statistical methods to analyse the effect of uncertainty on objectives. Quantitative risk assessment can be used to analyse the impact on cost (known as quantitative risk cost analysis) or time objectives (known as quantitative risk schedule analysis)."

      "content": "9.2.3.1 Risk responses\nThe best actions to take in response to risks will depend on the particular situation and type of risk. Different responses may be appropriate for threats and opportunities.\nTable 9.1 Risk responses (Lists and defines the use of response options: Avoid a threat, Exploit an opportunity, Reduce a threat, Enhance an opportunity, Transfer the risk, Share the risk, Accept the risk, and Prepare contingent plans.)\nIf a threat is reduced rather than removed, the largest realistic probability or size of impact of the risk that remains is called the ‘residual’ risk. If the residual risk is significant, then it may be appropriate to select more than one risk response.\nIn some cases, implementing a risk response will reduce or remove other related risks. It is also possible that the responses to risks will change some aspect of the project after they have been implemented. Consequently, this may lead to secondary risks (risks that occur as a result of invoking a risk response). It is essential that these are identified, assessed, and controlled in the same way as the initially identified risk.\nIt is important that risk responses balance the cost of implementing the response against the probability and impact of allowing the risk to occur. One way to assess this is to compare the cost of the risk response with the difference in the expected monetary value of the risk. This is the product of the estimated most likely financial impact of a risk and its estimated probability, both before and after the risk response. If the cost of the risk response is lower than the reduction in the expected monetary value, then it is usually worth undertaking the risk response. However, it is always worth remembering the overall effect of all risk response activities on the project team, as it may move their focus away from delivering the project to risk response actions.\nScenario: example of a response to an opportunity (NowByou example: project manager exploits opportunity to advertise campaign at NGO Summit using a free stand.)\nScenario: example of a combination of responses to a risk (LouisShopping example: security risk managed by reducing (regular safety meetings, inspections) and transferring (indemnification clauses in contract) threats.)\n9.2.3.2 Risk owners and risk action owners\nAs part of controlling risks, it is essential that the risk owner, the risk action owner and their responsibilities are clearly identified.\nThe risk owner is responsible for the management, monitoring, and control of all aspects of a particular risk assigned to them, including the implementation of the selected responses to address the threats or to maximize the opportunities. The risk action owner owns an action to address a risk.\nSome actions may not be within the remit of the risk owner to control explicitly. In that situation, there should be a nominated owner of the action to address the risk. They will need to keep the risk owner up to date.\nScenario: example of combined risk owner/risk action owner (NowByou example: Project Manager is risk owner for NGO Summit opportunity, Head of Partnerships is risk action owner for implementation steps.)\n9.2.3.3 Risk budget\nIt might be appropriate to identify and ring-fence an explicit risk budget within the project’s budget. As the project progresses, some of the risks previously identified will occur and others will not. New risks may be identified during the life of the project, whereby response costs will not have been included within the risk budget. This means that it is prudent to include a provision for unknown risks (those yet to be identified) in the risk budget.\nKey message: As the risk budget is part of the project budget, there may be a tendency to treat it as just another sum of money that the project manager can spend. This culture should be discouraged, and the risk management approach should define the mechanisms for the control of, and access to, this budget.\n9.2.4 Risk culture\nThe risk culture of the business should be reflected in its risk appetite. A supportive risk culture recognizes the importance of considering risk as an important part of decision-making.\nAn aspect of culture that will affect decisions and risk management is decision bias, which is the inherent tendency for people to adopt mental shortcuts or faulty thinking processes to process situations and make decisions. Decision bias is natural and largely positive, allowing the brain to efficiently make rapid decisions every day.\nHowever, sometimes decision bias can result in less effective decision-making. There are many types of bias, for example:\n● Optimism bias A mindset that drives people to discount disadvantageous risk, on the assumption that things are likely to be successful for them.\n● Loss aversion A mindset that values the avoidance of loss rather than making a gain.\n● Groupthink A mindset that makes people value social cohesion in a group more than expressing an alternative point of view or reaching the right decision.\n● Proximity A mindset where situations that are closer in time are seen as riskier and more important than those in the future.\nUnderstanding and overcoming these are important considerations when identifying risks and potential responses.\nScenario: culture example (FindefTwo programme manager utilized external advisors to encourage a culture of critical reasoning and overcome groupthink regarding risk management.)"

      "content": "PRINCE2 includes a five-step risk management technique (identify, assess, plan, implement, and communicate) as shown in figure 9.2, based on Management of Risk: Creating and Protecting Value.\nAn alternative procedure can be used if desired, for example, if the project is part of a programme that has a programme-wide risk management technique. The use of an alternative procedure should be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nAlthough this technique mentions reports, this does not preclude the use of systems and data from performing the same function.\nFigure 9.2 PRINCE2 technique for risk management\nIn the ‘identify’ step, the plan’s context and objectives are reviewed so that threats and opportunities can be identified.\nThe ‘assess’ step involves prioritizing risks and assessing the combined risk profile.\nThe ‘plan’ step involves deciding on risks responses and monitoring arrangements.\nThe ‘implement’ step involves establishing monitoring arrangements and execute actions for priority risks or realized risks.\nThe ‘communicate’ step is how information regarding opportunities and threats are communicated within the project ecosystem and, where needed, externally to stakeholders from the organizational ecosystem. The communicate step operates throughout as the outputs of any of the other steps may need to be communicated to stakeholders at any point in the process.\nAll the steps are repeatable. When additional information becomes available, it is often necessary to repeat earlier steps based on the new information. These steps are described in more detail below.\n9.3.1.1 Identify\n9.3.1.1.1 Define context and objectives\nThis step involves obtaining information about the project to ensure that there is a common understanding of the specific objectives that are at risk and to formulate an appropriate risk management approach.\nThe following will have an influence on the project’s risk management approach:\n● user’s quality expectations\n● the number of organizations involved and the relationships between them\n● the needs of the stakeholders involved with the project\n● the importance, complexity, and scale of the project\n● the delivery method being used (linear-sequential, iterative-incremental, hybrid)\n● what assumptions have been made\n● the business’ own environment (legislative or governance requirements)\n● business policies, standards, processes, and procedures\n● whether the project is part of a programme.\nThis information will be derived from the project mandate, the project brief, and the project product description.\nIt is a common error to try to identify specific risks before completing this process. Without a shared understanding of the objectives at risk, there is a danger that the uncertainties identified are not related to the objectives. There is no risk if the uncertainty does not impact one or more of the defined objectives.\n9.3.1.1.2 Identify threats and opportunities\nRisks can be identified at any time during the management and delivery of the project. Any member of the project, business, or other stakeholder may raise a risk. Risks are captured in the risk register as soon as they are identified. More information about the risk is gathered and developed through the subsequent steps.\n9.3.1.2 Assess\n9.3.1.2.1 Prioritize risks\nThe next step is to assess the probability of each risk and its impact to ensure that stakeholders understand the most important risks. This involves assessing:\n● the probability that the risk will occur (often estimated by considering its probability or frequency)\n● the impact of each risk in terms of the project objectives (for example, if the objectives are measured in time and cost, the impacts should also be measured in units of time and cost)\n● the impact of the risk on the stage plan, project plan, and business case\n● how the impact of the threats and opportunities may change over the life of the project\n● whether the project team is best placed to manage the risk or the risk needs to be escalated to the project board, an overarching programme, or a corporate body.\nThe risk register should be kept up-to-date with this information.\n9.3.1.2.2 Assess combined risk profile\nThe combined effect of the individual risks needs to be understood to determine if the overall risk exposure of the project remains within the risk appetite determined by the business and applied by the project board. If the risk exposure is greater than the overall risk appetite, then control actions will need to be planned in response.\nIn line with PRINCE2’s continued business justification principle, the justification of the project should be evaluated in the context of the risk exposure. There is no such thing as a risk-free project and understanding how risk exposure compares with the risk tolerance informs how much effort is put into risk responses.\n9.3.1.3 Plan\nThis step involves identifying and evaluating the appropriate risk response to remove or reduce threats, and to maximize opportunities. Typical risk responses are summarized in table 9.1.\nAny chosen response needs to be included in the appropriate level of plan. For more significant risks, it may be appropriate to establish not only early warning indicators to identify whether the risk is likely to materialize but also plans for managing the risk should it occur.\nThe risk response needs to identify the most appropriate body to manage a risk. This may not be the project team, especially if:\n● The project team does not have within its scope of influence the ability to implement an appropriate risk response.\n● The realization of the risk will materially impact the project’s business justification.\n● The project is part of a programme, and it would be more appropriate for the risk to be managed at the programme level. For example, if a specific project identifies a risk that is common across projects within the programme.\n● The implementation of a risk response will cause the project to exceed agreed tolerances. This might typically occur in a regulated organization where certain risks might either be reported by the business or where the realization of the risk might cause a breach of a regulatory condition.\nIf the risk falls within the tolerances set for the project, the project manager may decide the appropriate response. Otherwise, the decision is escalated to the project board. Subject to the risk tolerance, the risk might be escalated to the business. The escalation of risks is good practice and should not be seen as a failure. The earlier the risks are escalated, the more time that is available to implement any corrective actions.\n9.3.1.4 Implement\nPlanned risk responses need to be actioned, their effectiveness reviewed, and corrective action taken where responses do not match expectations. It is critical to ensure that the responsibilities for the risk owner and risk action owner are identified and agreed for each risk (see section 9.2.3.2 for further information on risk owners and risk action owners).\nIn some cases, the risk owner and risk action owner are likely to be the same person. The risk owner should be the person most capable of managing the risk. The allocation of too many risks to any one individual should be avoided.\n9.3.1.5 Communicate\nCommunication should be undertaken continually. This step ensures that information related to the threats and opportunities faced by the project is communicated both within the project ecosystem and externally to stakeholders from the organizational ecosystem. Risks are communicated in:\n● checkpoint reports\n● highlight reports\n● end stage reports\n● exception reports\n● issue reports\n● end project reports.\nThere are many other communication methods that could be considered alongside the PRINCE2 management products (such as bulletins, notice boards, dashboards, information radiators, discussion threads, and briefings). Project teams should refer to the communication management approach for the most appropriate method to communicate risk information with stakeholders.\nA project’s exposure to risk is never static; effective communication is key to the identification of new risks or changes in existing risks. This depends on the maintenance of a good communications network, including relevant contacts and sources of information, to facilitate the identification of changes that may affect the project’s overall risk exposure."

They may help project teams identify the root cause of a risk, which can then be targeted to reduce its impact or probability.\n9.3.2.2 Horizon scanning/PESTLE/SWOT analysis\nThese techniques examine the internal and external environments and enable understanding of the current and future risk landscapes that may result in threats and opportunities for the project.\nFigure 9.3 SWOT analysis for LouisShopping project\nPESTLE analysis reviews the current external landscape by looking at the political, economic, sociological, technological, legal, and environmental factors that cause uncertainties for the project. SWOT analysis looks at current strengths and weaknesses that may result in opportunities or threats. Horizon scanning looks further ahead to gather data on emerging trends and potential future developments that may impact the overall levels of risk exposure.\n9.3.2.3 Prompt lists\nPrompt lists are useful to identify the risk context and individual risks facing the project. Types of prompt list include:\n● PESTLE or SWOT analysis\n● risk breakdown structure, where different types of risks are broken down to identify specific risks\n● risk prompt lists generated from lessons learned reports by the business for common project activities (such as a risk prompt list for an office move).\n9.3.2.4 Pre-mortem\nThis technique looks backwards from a future point when objectives should have been achieved, painting a scenario of either success or failure. An analysis of the steps that contributed to achieving the future result can help to identify the threats or opportunities that should be considered.\n9.3.2.5 The Swiss cheese model\nThe Swiss cheese model shows that for a risk to actually occur, multiple levels of controls must fail (or in the Swiss cheese analogy, the holes in the cheese must align). This technique is useful for considering whether risk controls are sufficient.\n9.3.2.6 Use of data\nThe use of data to identify, analyse, and control risks can give deeper insight into and understanding of the risks facing a project, the relationships between them, and the most appropriate controls for risk mitigation. For example, use of data analytics on data sets containing similar projects, products, or tasks may provide a better understanding of the project’s predisposition to certain risks and therefore their probability, impact, and priority. Robotic process automation (RPA) may be used to automate aspects of the risk procedure to aid the assignment of actions and the monitoring, reporting, and escalation of risks."

For example, on a fixed price contract, any cost overruns will impact the supplier’s business case, but timescale overruns will typically impact the customer’s business case.\nIn order to adapt and tailor PRINCE2 in the best way possible, it is important to assess the context in which a project exists with regard to the environment and the working relationships.

For example, a risk management approach that includes monthly risk review meetings will struggle to support an iterative-incremental delivery method with two-week sprints.\nThe PRINCE2 method does not require a particular format for risk management products, nor specific timings for risk management activities. What is important is that they are appropriate for the format and pace of the project. For example, in an agile delivery method, risks in a risk register may be written on a whiteboard and reviewed as part of a daily stand-up meeting. In this context, this manual approach may be just as valid as using a specialized IT system to capture and review risks.\nIt is also important to recognize that the project’s delivery method might work to mitigate or reinforce specific risks. For example, an agile way of working inherently ensures that users do not overspecify requirements at the beginning of a project, which can be a risk in a more linear approach.\nAlthough agile is characterized by a high level of engagement with the users directly involved in the project, if not managed correctly, it can lead to uncontrolled changes to the agreed baseline. Linear approaches tend to reinforce the impression of ‘controlled change’ but can appear unresponsive and alienate users. It is of importance that the risk management approach recognizes these inherent differences."

It is possible for projects to create impacts that far outweigh their apparent size, scale, and complexity.\nIt is important that the risk management approach supports effective decision-making in the project and does not create an undue burden or bureaucracy. In general, smaller, simpler projects will need correspondingly simpler risk management arrangements, and larger, more complex projects will need more thorough controls. For example, in a simple project, the project manager would typically directly undertake most risk management activities. However, in more complex projects these activities might be delegated to a dedicated risk manager or risk management team. Similarly, risks might be held in a simple list on a whiteboard, in a spreadsheet, or in a dedicated system. It is important to ensure that the approach to risk management is appropriate and understood by everyone involved in the project.\nThe risk budget is based on the aggregate cost of all the project’s planned risk responses.

      "content": "Changes are not incorporated into the project baseline until they have been approved by the individual or role delegated with the appropriate authority.\nDefinition: Project baseline\nThe current approved versions of the management products and project products that are subject to change control.\nIt is important not to judge issues before they are assessed. Change is not something to avoid. All projects encounter changes, and they must be addressed, not ignored. The key is to handle changes in a responsive but controlled way.\nThe PRINCE2 issue management approach comprises:\n● Baselines describes what is subject to change control\n● Issue resolution how issues are identified, captured, assessed, and recommended for resolution\n● Change control describes how changes to the project baseline are controlled\n● Delegating authority for changes allocating authority from the project board down to enable a responsive but controlled way to handle changes\n● Change budget the money set aside in a plan to cover changes.\n10.2.1 Baselines\nChange can only be assessed in terms of its impact on the project as understood and approved by the project board. At any stage in its lifecycle, the project will comprise a set of management and specialist products. At any point in time, each product is either in preparation, development, or has been approved. In all cases they will be under change control.\nA prerequisite to effective issue management and change control is a way of creating baselines of products that allow changes to be analysed and controlled. A new version of the product is created each time a change is approved and implemented. Change control enables those involved to identify when changes have been made and to trace them to a decision made by the appropriate authority.\nThe issue management approach for a project is driven by the nature of the products to be delivered (the ‘what’) and the planned delivery activities (the ‘how’). Therefore, the preparation of this approach usually follows the preparation of product descriptions and work package descriptions.\nRegardless of size, scale, and complexity, the project management team needs to determine:\n● The appropriate level at which the products need to be baselined\n● this is generally determined by dividing the project products until they reach the level at which a component can be independently released, installed, replaced, or modified\n● the level of control exercised will be influenced by the importance of the project and the complexity of the relationships between its products.\n● How products and their versions are identified\n● generally, a system of some type will need to be established, providing a unique identifier for each product.\n● What information about products needs to be captured and maintained in the project log (for example, versions, status, and relationships with other products).\n● The specific authorities and authorizations needed to approve and baselines.\n● The procedure to follow to capture and manage issues and changes.\nIt is good practice to periodically verify that the actual status of the products reflects the authorized state of products and look for any discrepancies. This usually occurs through reviews or audits and is typically undertaken at the end of each stage and at the end of the project.\nProject baselines are often managed with a variety of systems. Management products may be maintained as documents with a simple way of indicating each version and its date of approval. Specialist products may require a dedicated system. However, each system should ensure that changes cannot be introduced without the appropriate level of approval and provide an audit trail for all changes. In addition, the product register element of the project log should record the approval and implementation of all changes to the project baseline.\n10.2.2 Issue resolution\nPRINCE2 recommends that all issues are categorized as either:\n● a problem or concern\n● an event external to the project\n● a business opportunity\n● a request for change\n● off-specification.\nThis assists the assessment and also provides valuable data on the type of issues that are repeatedly being raised which can indicate another aspect of project management is not working. It is good practice when assessing categorizing issues to check whether the issue is actually a risk. The distinction is that risks are uncertain. If this is the case the issue should be transferred to the risk register and the procedure in the risk management approach should be followed. Similarly, it is good practice to review and check whether the risk register includes any entries which are not uncertain and therefore should be managed as an issue.\nDefinition: Problem or concern\nA problem is an issue with an immediate and negative impact.\nA concern is an issue whose timeliness and impact need to be assessed.\nOften, issues are first presented informally in conversations or communications among project team members. This is particularly the case for issues that constitute a problem, concern, or business opportunity.\nHow to handle problems and concerns is often a matter of judgement. Capturing too many problems and concerns as issues can inundate the project management team with trivial decisions and distract them from the most important ones. On the other hand, project managers should avoid filtering or prejudging problems and concerns. It is most effective to identify issues early when they can generally be resolved within approved tolerances.\nIn some cases, the issue is an event external to the project that may impact the project in some way. For example, a supplier going out of business is outside the project’s control, but it may force the project management team to analyse the resulting impacts and consider finding an alternative supplier. This is why it is always advised to monitor the project’s external environment on a regular basis.\nScenario: formal versus informal issues (LouisShopping example: water storage tank issue is off-specification (formal) and recorded in issue register; non-working printer is informal and added to daily log.)\nDefinition: Business opportunity\nAn issue that represents unanticipated positive consequences for the project or user organization.\nNot all issues have negative consequences. In some cases, an issue occurs that represents a business opportunity with positive consequences. For example, significant savings in the cost of goods or services, or the availability of new equipment with improved functionality. The consequences of such business opportunities are not always limited to a project, so it can be useful to seek the advice of the project board when preparing the assessment of impacts and possible resolutions.\nIssues should be recorded in the issue register. For some issues, the details captured in the issue register are sufficient for the issue to be considered and an action agreed. However, some issues may require more detailed analysis and an issue report will be created. The issue report should identify the type of issue, assess its impact on the project baseline, and recommend how to resolve the issue. Decisions and actions relating to issues should be recorded in the issue register.\nIn some cases, the issue or its resolution will represent a change to the project baseline. This will then need to be addressed through the change control procedure.\n10.2.3 Change control\nDefinitions\nChange control The process by which changes that may affect the project baseline are identified, assessed, and then approved, rejected, or deferred.\nRequest for change A proposal for a change to a baseline.\nOff-specification A product that will not meet its quality specifications.\nConcession An off-specification that is accepted by the project board without corrective action.\nAll projects need an appropriate approach to control changes to the project baseline. The issue management approach describes the project’s change control procedure, including how proposals to change the project baseline will be recorded and decided.\nPRINCE2 characterizes proposals to change a project baseline as either a request for change or off specification.\nA request for change must identify the management products proposed to be changed and provide a justification for making the change. If there is a cost associated with the change, the source of its funding must be identified as either the approved change budget or additional funding.\nOff-specifications most often occur when a supplier fails to deliver a product that fully complies with its quality specifications. However, off-specification can also occur when a required quality specification is found to be unachievable. In either case, it represents a discrepancy between the approved project baseline and the delivered products, and this discrepancy must be addressed through the change control procedure.\nIf the off-specification is accepted, the project baseline must be changed to reflect the affected product description. Accepted off-specifications are known as concessions and require project board approval, or approval by those with delegated change authority. If the off-specification is rejected, the team manager in consultation with the project manager will need to explore how to correct the situation, including through possible use of the change budget or raising an exception report (see Chapter 11).\nIf an issue requires a request for a change or off-specification, the issue report should include the details of the proposed changes to enable timely decision-making.\nScenario: example of off-specification (LouisShopping example: construction contractor's failure to provide required parking spaces is off-specification.)\n10.2.4 Delegating authority for changes\nThe project board is the ultimate authority for reviewing and approving requests for change and off specifications. However, the project board may delegate authority to approve changes. Delegating authority for effective change control is a matter of balancing efficiency and control. If there is too little delegation, the project board is likely to slow the progress or be asked to review changes that others are better able to decide. Whereas, if there is too much delegation, particularly to too many different roles, there is an increased risk that the overall benefits of the project will be reduced as alignment with the business justification is diluted.\nIn a project where few changes are envisaged, it may be reasonable to leave this authority in the hands of the project board. However, for projects where there are likely to be many changes, the project board may choose to delegate some decisions.\nIn practice, most changes will be generated at the work package level. It is important to ensure that there is sufficient delegated authority to approve the changes for the work packages. In this way, changes can be made without always having to escalate decisions to the project board for approval.\nSubject to the scale and complexity of the project, it may be useful to delegate change authority to several levels within the project management team. This is based on parameters specified in the issue management approach.\n10.2.5 Change budget\nDefinition: Change budget\nThe money or authorized constraints set aside in a plan to cover changes. It is allocated by those with delegated authority to deliver authorized changes.\nThe project manager should ensure that delegated authority is accompanied by an appropriate change budget from which approved changes can be delivered. The change budget is usually an amount of money earmarked specifically to fund changes. However, it can also be defined as a set of authorized constraints within which trade-offs can be made."

      "content": "PRINCE2 includes a five-step issue management technique (capturing issues, assessing issues, recommending changes, deciding on changes, implementing changes) as shown in figure 10.1.\nAn alternative procedure can be used instead if desired. For example, if the project is part of a programme with established issue management procedure that is to be used by all the projects within the programme. The use of an alternative procedure should be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nFigure 10.1 PRINCE2 technique for issue management\n10.3.1.1 Capturing issues\nIssues can be captured through any of the formal or informal communication channels available during a project. However, the project manager should ensure that the means for translating issues from these channels into issue reports is efficient and involves minimum administrative burden. Review of new and open issues should be a part of all project reviews, from regular status meetings to stage boundary reviews.\nScenario: different ways to capture issues (Findef example: broken hard disk issue handled informally via daily log; logo change request is formal and recorded in issue register as a change request.)\n10.3.1.2 Assessing issues\nWhen reviewing issues, the aim is to answer these three questions:\n● What is the type of issue (a problem or concern, an event external to the project, a business opportunity, a request for change, or off-specification)?\n● Does this issue affect the project?\n● If so, how?\nMany issues will not need an extensive assessment or require the preparation of a request for change. However, in some cases, the first question cannot be answered in simple ‘yes or no’ terms. Instead, it has to be answered within the context of project tolerances and priorities. A project with tightly limited tolerances may need to restrict the types of issues it considers. On the other hand, some issues are purely informational or advisory, such as a change in working hours that does not result in an acceleration or delay in delivery activities.\nMajor issues or potential changes to the project baseline require an integrated assessment that considers them in the context of impacts on the overall project plan. The seven types of tolerances represent interrelated aspects of a project, and major issues and changes rarely affect only one aspect. Therefore, the assessment should consider the impact of an issue or change on:\n● the approved targets and tolerances\n● the project business case\n● other products or work packages.\nWhen possible, project managers should aim to offer the project board more than one way to respond to an issue or change. It is often possible to make trade-offs or concessions among requirements or tolerances, such as obtaining better performance from a product in return to allowing a delay in its delivery. Although all issues should be assessed, not all will necessitate a change. To reject it and do nothing can be a valid response to an issue.\nThe assessment of issues and the development of ways to resolve them is best approached in a cooperative manner by gathering inputs and ideas from a variety of project team members and stakeholders. This is particularly true when the issue has impacts and response options outside the scope of the project itself.\nIt may be useful to seek the advice of the project board to confirm its understanding of an issue’s priority or severity before completing the assessment and proposing options.\n10.3.1.3 Recommending resolution\nBased on the assessment, a recommendation is made to the appropriate person or group who has the required authority. Whether the recommendation is to approve or reject a request for change, the consequences of both choices should be made clear.\nFigure 10.2 Consequences of recommended option\n10.3.1.4 Deciding on changes\nTable 10.1 outlines the typical decision choices in response to a change proposal, whether it is a request for change or off-specification.\nTable 10.1 Choices in response to a change proposal (Lists responses (Approve, Reject, Ask for an exception plan, Request more information, Accept concession) and considerations for each type of change proposal (Request for change, Off-specification).)\n10.3.1.5 Implementing changes\nApproved requests for change and off-specifications should be recorded in the project log and reflected in the affected management products. The baselines of different management products may be maintained using different systems, but each system should enable configuration control by providing a record of changes and an archive of superseded versions."

Examples include:\n● Root cause analysis deconstructs a problem into its contributing causes with the aim of distinguishing one or more primary causes from other secondary or derivative ones.\n● Pareto analysis collects possible causes and identifies the most likely ones using the 80/20 rule, also known as the Pareto principle, which asserts that 80 percent of outcomes result from 20 percent of all causes. This is useful when multiple causes exist and no single one is the obvious source.\n● Cause and effect analysis sorts possible causes into various categories that diverge from the original problem, with the aim of identifying the most significant factors. This analysis is sometimes performed using a fishbone or Ishikawa diagram.\n● Failure mode analysis a step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a product or process and assessing the consequences of each. This usually requires some form of the product, either interim form (such as a prototype) or final form to exist.\n● Five whys uses a series of questions (such as ‘why did this happen?’) to investigate successive layers of a problem. The answer to each question becomes the basis of the next ‘why?’ question. This is a simple tool that is useful when detailed statistics are not needed or available.\nTo be effective, problem-solving techniques must be applied systematically.

      "content": "10.4.3.1 Linear-sequential projects\nA key assumption underlying the choice of a linear-sequential approach to a project is that the number and magnitude of changes will be reduced as the project lifecycle progresses. This is because it is generally much easier and less costly to make changes to the project baseline early in the project. For example, changing the size of a room in a construction project may be a trivial matter when the building is being designed but costly and time consuming when the building is nearly complete.\nFor this reason, the issue management approach may propose tailoring tolerances to allow flexibility in early stages, such as during design, when the impact of changes may be relatively small. Then, in later stages, such as during construction, the tolerances may be much more tightly restricted and a larger portion of the change budget made available, in recognition of the potential cost of even minor changes.\nScenario: speed of assessing issues (LouisShopping example: project manager assessed issue's impact on business case and schedule (delaying project) quickly and escalated for additional funding, avoiding further delays.)\n10.4.3.2 Iterative-incremental projects\nIssue management and change control are intrinsic to the iterative-incremental approach. The frequent review of progress and short cycles of delivery work (such as in agile methodologies) are intended to raise and resolve issues quickly. This is to allow the scope baseline (sometimes referred to as the product backlog) to evolve in a manner that keeps a close alignment between requirements and developed capabilities of the product.\nIf the entire scope of the project’s delivery activities follows an incremental-iterative approach, it may be sufficient for the project manager to ensure that issues are consistently captured, assessed, and decided. This would be in a manner that provides traceability back to the project product description and maintains an effective level of control.\nIn other cases, the project manager should consider structuring the issue management approach to allow the project board to retain change authority over management products. Meanwhile, delegating authority over changes in features and functionality in specialist products to the teams working within a framework such as PRINCE2 Agile. The issue management approach may include the agile technique of trading/swapping features in response to issues as a means of remaining within tolerance.\nAgile methods enable change late in the product development lifecycle to deliver a product that better matches user expectations with the biggest possible value. This philosophy applies when products are difficult to define in detail early in the project."

The three levels of management within the project (responsible for directing, managing, and delivering) will manage and implement within these tolerances and escalate any forecast breaches of project tolerance.\nThe project board has overall control at a project level if forecasts remain within project tolerance and will allocate tolerances for each stage to the project manager. The project board can review progress and decide whether to continue, change, or stop the project.

For example, this could be the end of a stage, the completion of the project initiation documentation, or the creation of an exception report. It could also include organizational events that may affect the project, such as the end of the financial year.\nTime-driven control A management control that occurs at predefined periodic intervals. For example, this could be producing highlight reports for the project board or checkpoint reports showing the progress of a work package.\nMonitoring is a time-based activity, control (decision-making) is an event-based activity, and reporting is both time-based and event-based. The use of event-driven controls drives efficiency as it means project management team do not meet unnecessarily or too frequently, but when most needed."

      "content": "As part of the controlling a stage process, the project manager will regularly review progress through checkpoint reports and will maintain the project log. The project manager will use this information to update the stage plan with the actual progress achieved. The format and frequency of checkpoint reporting will depend on the needs of individual work packages. It is only possible to control progress at the level of detail in the plans. For example, if weekly checkpoint reports are required, the stage plan will have to include what needs to be achieved week by week.\nIt is also necessary to analyse the project data for trends to get a view of the overall health of the stage. For example, the stage may seem to be progressing well in terms of the products being completed against the schedule. However, the issue register may reveal an increasing number of issues that are not being resolved and may be a cause for concern. Similarly, the quality register may reveal there are a number of products that have failed a test and not yet been recorded as having been re-tested in the quality register.\nActions may arise from many sources and small actions may simply be recorded on the daily log and marked when completed. The daily log can also be used to record informal issues and any other notes or observations that are not captured by any other management product.\nThe difference between a formal issue and an informal issue is that a formal issue will be captured in the issue register as an open forum. There, it will then be monitored and reviewed due to its material impact on the project or stage. An informal issue is one that either does not have a material impact or requires handling in a suitable manner where open access would be inappropriate. The daily log is a useful way of recording individual observations that on their own may seem insignificant but when collated may alert the project manager to a new issue or risk.\nThe product register also provides data on the status of the products that are complete, currently in progress, and those awaiting development. The data from this register may be compared with the physical status of the products to provide assurance on the progress of the project.\nA principle of a PRINCE2 project is that the project management team learns from experience. Therefore, the project team actively seeks, records, and incorporates relevant lessons throughout the life of the project, applies them to the remaining work and shares them for future projects. It is often in the reviewing of progress that lessons are identified. The project log includes a lessons log, which is used for capturing lessons and is accessed when reviewing progress.\nDefinition: Lesson\nA lesson is information to facilitate the future of the project or other projects and actively promote learning from experience. The experience may be positive, as in a successful test or outcome, or negative, as in a mishap or failure.\nTo record lessons during a project is good for the organization, project team, and other existing and future projects. Lessons are the documented information that reflect both the positive and negative experiences of a project. Lessons can be captured:\n● during a post-project review\n● during any meetings throughout the project (you do not have to wait until a post-project review to share lessons)\n● via PRINCE2 management products like checkpoint reports or highlight reports\n● by performing retrospectives\n● when issues occur\n● during stakeholder one-to-one meetings\n● using electronic workspaces where data and information are shared.\nThe analysis of a lesson should answer five questions in the following order:\n● What did we expect to occur?\n● What actually happened?\n● What worked well and why?\n● What did not work and why?\n● What needs to be done differently or what needs to be repeated?\nDocument management systems or team collaboration systems are a useful tool in sharing and reporting knowledge from lessons.\nIt should be noted that systems and data play a major part in reviewing progress. Any reports, registers, or logs mentioned above may originate from a system where the data is integrated and accessible. This would be in accordance with the digital and data management approach, and presented electronically with drill-down capabilities to access more detail.\nScenario: example of analysing a lesson (LouisShopping example: electric power distribution issue led to rework; project manager used a meeting and a subsequent audit of drawings to identify the cause (outdated floor plan) and correct the problem, capturing lessons learned.)"

For example, if the team is highly experienced, then less frequent reporting may be appropriate. Whereas, for an inexperienced team, the project manager or project board may wish to increase the frequency of reporting until sufficient confidence has been gained in the capability of the team.\nTable 11.2 Reports provided by PRINCE2 (Lists Checkpoint report, Highlight report, Lesson report, Issue report, Exception report, End stage report, and End project report, with their origin, type, and use.)\nPRINCE2 does not define the composition, format, or presentation for reports, which should consider the quality management, risk management, and issue management approaches. If part of a programme, the information should also consider the programme’s monitoring and control requirements.\nReports may take the form of an electronic dashboard, which has aggregated and summarized data from an integrated system. These dashboards may be available to the respective stakeholder audience, such as for the directing, managing, or delivering levels of the project. These are based on the access and availability stipulated in the digital and data management approach.\nAdditionally, an information snapshot of the status of products within the project, stage, or a particular area of the project to support the findings of a progress review can be found in the product register on a self-service basis. Data for this snapshot may be found within a system rather than in a manually generated document or spreadsheet.\nThe reporting of lessons could include information about the development of a product or the project management practices, processes, procedures, techniques, or tools used that either contributed to the project’s achievements or caused a problem. Examples might include the performance of the project management team, the methods used, or the analysis of quality data and measurements. Larger projects are more likely to utilize a lessons report as part of this procedure, where more detail would be helpful.\nScenario: difference between event-driven and time-driven (LouisShopping example: operation needs assessment review is event-driven; project board meetings are time-driven.)"

An exception is defined as a situation where it can be forecast that there will be a deviation beyond the agreed tolerance levels will occur. It is not necessary, and indeed not helpful, to wait until that deviation has occurred. Therefore, forecasting within projects is essential because it helps to identify responses to project risks, predict project outcomes, and help ensure overall project success.\nIt is important to consider the performance of the project so far and other projects inside or outside the organization. Although time and cost are often stated as the key metrics to track, all seven PRINCE2 performance targets should be considered.\nThe collected data is then sifted, collated, and analysed to provide the project manager with sufficient information on the past performance to predict the future risks and outcomes, as well as determine whether the project retains a continued business justification. Again, the data may be held in an integrated system, which may also allow for ‘what if’ scenario forecasting, to ease the forecasting workload for project managers.\nThe digital and data management approach will describe what systems and data will be used by the project to assist with forecasting. This may involve using data from outside the project or the business, for example, from a data trust as a reference class to enable predictive data analytics to be used."

Project data may be in the form of project documentation, correspondence, project log, and records. It includes both internal and external data, as well as digital and non-digital formats.\nThe collection of data within projects has evolved dramatically with the introduction of digital technology to plan and schedule projects. These systems will capture, validate, and present data against the plans and milestones for ease of understanding progress. Data analytics is the means of using and analysing data to support effective decision-making or to bring efficiency through the automation of tasks.\nProgress reviews are not confined to looking backwards. After having secured and stored the data through systems, past performance can be used to predict future performance. To ensure clarity, this information can then be presented in the stakeholders’ preferred format and style.\nThe project management team must decide what they require from the reporting and forecasting procedures. Then, they should select a solution to fit both the requirements and the level of maturity of the business and the organizations that are involved in the project. The business may already have established systems through a centralized programme or project office. Or the nature of the project may require new systems to be designed, (possibly) procured, and established. For example, the use of digital twins and building information modelling (BIM) in construction projects.\nThe project’s digital and data management approach will explain what digital technology will be used to support project management and project work as well as how the data will be used and which systems will be used for data analytics. For example, the use of sentiment analysis to understand team performance or stakeholder engagement.\nThe management products used for checking the baselines, reviewing progress, capturing, and reporting lessons, reporting progress, or forecasting are frequently recognized by the project manager as a combination of disparate sources. Automation, for example the use of artificial intelligence, is removing the need for a manual approach, enabling project professionals to focus on far more value-added tasks rather than administration.\nDue to home working and globalization, project teams are more likely to be distributed across multiple locations rather than co-located. Therefore, the use of digital systems can help to communicate and transfer data or information. If the team and the data are up-to-date, information management is more reliable and easier to administer in an automated system.\nScenario: difference between event-driven and time-driven (LouisShopping example: operation needs assessment review is event-driven; project board meetings are time-driven.)"

      "subsubtopic": null,
      "content": "11.3.1 PRINCE2 technique for exception management\nPRINCE2 includes a six-step exception management technique shown in figure 11.3. An alternative procedure can be used instead if desired, for example, if the project is part of a programme that has a programme-wide exception management procedure. The use of an alternative procedure should be documented as part of the tailoring decisions in the project initiation documentation.\nAlthough this technique mentions reports, this does not preclude the use of systems and data from performing the same function.\nFigure 11.3 PRINCE2 technique for exception management\nIssues are often encountered in the delivering level of the project that will take the stage outside one of the stage tolerances. It may also occur during the managing level for those issues that are not driven from delivery problems.\nFigure 11.3 shows the steps of the exception management technique from the delivering level to the directing level.\n11.3.1.1 Step 1\nFrom the work package data, the team manager forecasts that one or more of the products in the work package will take the work package outside one of its tolerances. At this point, an issue is raised for the attention of the project manager. If the issue can be resolved by the project manager within the stage tolerances, the resolution will not require an exception report to be created. However, the issue will be reported in the next highlight to the project board, and a note may be made in the lessons log.\n11.3.1.2 Step 2\nIf the issue will affect the stage (or project) tolerances to the point that they are forecast to be breached, an exception report is created by the project manager detailing the situation with resolution options and a recommendation.\nThe exception report is sent to the project board or project executive at the directing level, along with any other relevant data to assist in their decision.\n11.3.1.3 Step 3\nThe project board or project executive have several options that they could take. They may:\n● reallocate the overall project tolerances to resolve the breach of the stage tolerance\n● reprioritize the requirements to bring the stage back within tolerance (de-scoping or re-scoping the product)\n● inform the project manager that they require more time to consider their options\n● implement the exception report and request an exception plan from the project manager\n● implement the exception report by escalating to the business layer for advice and direction, if the exception will take the project outside one or more of its project level tolerances\n● the business layer will provide direction to the project board, which will then direct the project manager accordingly.\n11.3.1.4 Step 4\nThe project manager ceases the current stage and introduces a stage boundary to create the exception plan and adjust any other related information in the project initiation documentation. An end stage report may also be produced where the stage has progressed to a point where this would be useful data for the decision.\n11.3.1.5 Step 5\nThe project board or project executive will assess the exception plan and may take a number of options. They may:\n● reject the exception plan and request amendments from the project manager\n● reject the exception plan and direct the project manager to continue with the stage\n● this may require minor adjustments to the current stage\n● approve the exception plan and return it to the project manager for further action.\n11.3.1.6 Step 6\nThe exception plan will be received by the project manager with a direction to implement it as a new stage plan. In effect, the exception plan becomes the new stage plan. The project manager authorizes the next set of work packages for the delivering level to recommence, taking into consideration the issue that triggered the exception.\nConsideration should be given to aligning the new stage end with the old stage end if desirable or feasible. This ensures that the planned end stage assessments by the project board or project executive do not require rescheduling and are still aligned with the original requirements for a decision at that point in the project. A product flow diagram can also be used to map progress while at the same time reminding the project board of the dependencies and sequencing of products.\n11.3.2 Supporting techniques\nMeasuring the progress of a stage involves looking backward at the progress made against plans and forward at what still needs to be completed with available time and resources. However, effective progress management requires an open and transparent culture with a no blame attitude to progress reporting.\nThere are many supporting techniques, and those mentioned below may be used in isolation or combined depending on the needs of the project or team. For example, the solution developers may use Kanban as a team board to demonstrate progress and hold daily stand-ups for reporting purposes.\n11.3.2.1 Dashboards\nA dashboard is a technique to represent vast amounts of decision supporting information at an amalgamated level using tabular and graphic representation, such as graphs and traffic lights.\nFigure 11.4 Example highlight report for NowByou campaign\nScenario: an example of a dashboard (NowByou example: dashboard used as a highlight report, showing RAG status, accomplished/planned activities, pending decisions, critical risks/issues, financials, and milestones.)\n11.3.2.2 Daily stand-ups\nDaily stand-ups are daily meetings that are conducted quickly. All team members attend, and although the original meaning of the term implied that this meeting was conducted with everyone standing up, this is now rarely the case, with virtual meetings becoming more common in today’s environment. The intention is that it makes for a brisk, focused meeting. Progress is reviewed, and every team member declares their next steps, using the three guiding questions which are:\n● What have you done since yesterday?\n● What are you planning to do today?\n● Have you encountered any problems or issues?\nPart of the value of the daily stand-up is that everyone in the team maintains awareness of what everyone else is doing. This creates an opportunity within an organized, empowered team for one team member to offer timely help or suggestions to another team member.\nScenario: example of a virtual stand-up (Data Knowledge example: virtual daily stand-ups used to share progress and detect roadblocks; builds team cohesion; uses product flow diagram.)\n11.3.2.3 Earned value management\nThis is a technique to create an integrated project baseline combining scope, schedule, and cost performance by comparing the completed products and the actual cost and time taken against their schedule and cost estimates. Besides providing an objective assessment of past performance, it can be used to forecast total project cost and duration based on historical performance. PRINCE2’s approach to product-based planning provides information to support earned value management.\n11.3.2.4 Peer review\nA peer review is where people experienced in project management but outside the project management team are asked to evaluate the project. Peer reviews may also be held between subject matter experts in relation to a particular product. There are many peer review techniques, and the quality management approach should identify the techniques appropriate to the project.\n11.3.2.5 Burn charts\nThis is a technique for showing progress (for example, during a timebox), where work that is completed and work still to be done are shown with one or more lines, and the chart is updated regularly (perhaps daily). This is one of the most popular techniques when using an agile approach.\nBurn charts come in two forms: burn-down charts and burn-up charts. Burn-down charts are the most well-known, and they show how much work remains, whereas burn-up charts show how much work has been done.\nBurn-down charts identify estimation issues early and help viewers to understand how much work and effort remains. Burn charts help motivate teams by showing progress toward the project’s outcome.\nFigure 11.5 Burn down chart\n11.3.2.6 Retrospectives\nA retrospective is a type of progress review that specifically considers the way of working as opposed to looking at what was produced.\nTo be fully effective, a retrospective should be planned, structured, and actively facilitated. They can be quite informal, but if they are run as an unstructured meeting, they are likely to become ineffective and not contribute to better ways of working.\nRunning an effective retrospective is similar to running a successful workshop, and should consider:\n● inviting the right people (normally just the team, and possibly project support)\n● having an independent facilitator\n● focusing on a small number of issues that can be actioned, rather than a larger number that are unlikely to result in action\n● different, creative approaches to keep the retrospectives interesting and useful\n● visual feedback tools to help people express their ideas.\n11.3.2.7 Kanban board\nKanban is a term that covers the use of Kanban systems, which are visual management systems that limit the number of work items in circulation. A Kanban board is a tool used in Kanban to visually display the work in the system. It usually comprises a series of columns (and possibly rows) where work items move from left to right as they move through the various states to be completed. A Kanban board acts like a dashboard and enables the team to see blockers and areas where the flow is not smooth.\nFigure 11.6 Kanban board example for timebox 1"

Additional considerations apply if the relationship between the customer and the supplier is a commercial one.\nThe contract between the parties acts as a constraint on a project manager’s or team manager’s degree of freedom when managing the project or work package. For this reason, it is good practice to ensure that contracts reflect and promote good working relations rather than inhibiting them and that any tailoring to PRINCE2 respects the parties’ contract obligations.\nFrom a supplier’s perspective, the project lifecycle should be defined to consider pre-contract activities, such as qualification, designing and costing the solution, bidding, and negotiation. It may also consider activities at the end of the project, such as warranty and maintenance periods."

The tolerances would have been set in accordance with this. The frequent delivery of products that meet their acceptance and quality specifications is a primary source of progress information and provides the basis for forecasting future progress.\nThe formality of reporting may differ in an iterative-incremental project using agile techniques such as Kanban and burn-down or burn-up charts. Checkpoint reporting may be based on a ‘pull’ system, where the project manager reviews the charts maintained by the development teams rather than being sent by them.\nBy contrast, for a project using a linear-sequential delivery method, the focus may be on when the stage’s products will be complete and for what costs. In this way, the project board can be confident that there is a robust basis to move from the current stage to the next."

Therefore, it will require evidence to support compliance. Progress management must be able to identify and report on the data required to support this evidence.\nThe project executive may request an audit of the project if compliance against sustainability regulations is required. Advice should be sought from the quality assurance function with the business or programme.\nSustainability reporting should not be separate from the agreed reporting requirements but rather integrated into the cyclical analysis of the project data by the project manager, team managers, and project support. The activities in the plans should consider the data needed to satisfy sustainability analysis, just as they should for the other tolerances within the project. This is so that evidential reporting on sustainability is a consequence of progress management and not something that requires additional activities or resource."

The style may be more relaxed, and this could lead the project manager to report progress in a structured email rather than a formal report, for example.\nFor simple projects, questions that may be asked are:\n● Do all the management products need to be used?\n● Could some of the management products be combined?\n● Could the data be distributed in a more effective and efficient manner?\n● Could access to the data be given to stakeholders in accordance with the digital and data management approach?\nAs the projects become more complex and attract more risk, the project business may include more stakeholders with different reporting requirements. Under these circumstances, a more formal approach to evaluation and reporting, either through structured reports or through the use of data and systems, will be required to satisfy the stakeholder requirements.\nThe project executive or project board must agree on the frequency of reporting and have the project manager record their requirements in the project initiation documentation."

Date the date logged, assessed, or actioned.\nManagement product: Lessons log\nPurpose: The purpose of the lessons log is to provide a repository to record lessons that apply to this project or future projects. Some lessons may originate from other projects and should be captured on the lessons log for input to the project’s approaches and plans. Some lessons may originate from within the project, where new experience (both good and bad) can be applied to this project and/or passed on to others. High-level content: Lesson identifier unique reference for the lesson. Lesson description a summary of the lesson and associated details, for example, the effect (such as positive/negative financial impact), known cause/trigger, whether there were any early warning indicators, whether it was previously identified as a risk (threat or opportunity), recommendations. Lesson type for example, team lesson, project lesson, business layer lesson. Lesson owner who is responsible for actioning any learning from the lesson (could be from a team, the project, or the business). Grading a rating of priority and severity. Status the current status of the lesson, for example, logged, reviewed, learning actioned (by project), and learning actioned (by business). Relevant dates related to the lesson for example, date raised, date last reviewed, action due dates, and date resolved. Records list of the documents associated with the issue and their location.\nManagement product: Checkpoint report\nPurpose: The purpose of a checkpoint report is to report to the project manager the status of the work package at a frequency defined in the work package.\nHigh-level content: Executive summary team manager’s report. Period the reporting period covered by the checkpoint report. Follow-ups the outstanding items from previous reports (for example, action items completed or unresolved). This reporting period the products being developed by the team during the reporting period; the products completed by the team during the reporting period; quality management activities performed during the period; lessons identified. Next reporting period the products being developed by the team in the next reporting period; the products planned to be completed by the team in the next reporting period; quality management activities planned for the next reporting period. Work package tolerance status how execution of the work package is performing against its tolerances (for example, cost/time/scope actuals and forecast). Issues and risks an update on issues and risks associated with the work package.\nManagement product: Highlight report\nPurpose: The purpose of a highlight report is to provide the project board (and possibly other stakeholders) with a summary of the stage status at intervals defined by them.\nHigh-level content: Executive summary project manager’s report. Period the reporting period covered by the highlight report. Follow-ups the outstanding items from previous reports (for example, action items completed or unresolved). This reporting period the actual progress of work packages, including those pending authorization, in execution, and completed in the period (if any work packages are being performed by external suppliers, this information may be accompanied by purchase order and invoicing data); products completed in the period; products planned but not started or completed in the period (providing an early warning indicator or potential breach of time tolerance); any corrective actions taken during the period. Next reporting period forecast progress of work packages, including those to be authorized, in execution and to be completed during the next period (if the work packages are being performed by external suppliers, this information may be accompanied by purchase order and invoicing data); products to be completed in the next period; corrective actions to be completed during the next period. Stage and project tolerance status how execution of the project and stage are performing against their tolerances (for example, cost/time actuals and forecast). Key issues and risks a summary of actual or potential issues and risks (including a list of requests for change or off-specifications raised, actioned, or pending for the period). Lessons (if appropriate) a review of what went well, what went badly, and any recommendations for consideration by the business; sourced from the lessons log or any lessons reports that may exist.\nManagement product: Lessons report\nPurpose: The purpose of a lessons report is to share lessons and trigger actions to ensure that lessons become embedded in the appropriate organization’s way of working. A lessons report can be created at any time in a project and should not necessarily be delayed until the end. Typically they can be included as part of the end stage report or end project report. It may be appropriate (and necessary) for there to be several lessons reports specific to a particular organization (for example user, supplier, business).\nHigh-level content: Executive summary a summary of the lesson. Description for work package, stage, or project lessons a review of what went well, what went badly, and recommendations for this project or future projects. Description for a specific lesson the effect (for example, positive/negative financial impact), cause/trigger if known/proven, whether there were any early warning indicators, whether it was previously identified as a risk (threat or opportunity), recommendations for this project or future projects.\nManagement product: Exception report\nPurpose: The purpose of an exception report is to inform the project board when a stage plan or project plan is forecast to exceed tolerance levels set and to offer options and recommendations for the way to proceed.\nHigh-level content: Identifier unique identifier for the exception. Date the date issued. Description an overview of the exception being reported. Cause of the exception a description of the cause of a deviation from the current plan. Consequences of the exception what the implications are if the deviation is not addressed for the project and the business. Options which options are available to address the deviation, and the effect of each option on the business case, risks, and tolerances. Recommendation of the available options, which is recommended, and why. Lessons what can be learned from the exception on this project or future projects.\nManagement product: End stage report\nPurpose: The purpose of an end stage report is to give a summary of progress to date, the overall project situation, and sufficient information to ask for a project board’s decision on what to do next with the project.\nHigh-level content: Executive summary project manager’s report. Performance review a review of the business case, project objectives, stage objectives, team performance, quality activities, products’ status, phased handover of products (if applicable), and lessons. Summary of follow-on action recommendations actions to be taken by the business following the phased handover of any products during the stage. Key issues and risks a summary of the actual or potential issues and risks (including a list of requests for change or off-specifications raised, actioned, or pending for the period). Forecast for next stage and project against targets and their tolerances.\nManagement product: End project report\nPurpose: The purpose of the end project report is to review how the project performed against the version of the project initiation documentation used to authorise it.\nHigh-level content: Executive summary project manager’s report. Performance review a review of the business case, project objectives, and team performance. Product review a review of products, concessions, off-specifications, project product handover, and lessons. Summary of follow-on action recommendations any post-project actions to be taken by the business or supplier(s)."

This is done in the process of starting up a project (see Chapter 13), in which the project manager and project board are appointed, and a project brief and a stage plan for the initiation stage are created. The decision to proceed with project initiation is taken by the project board using their own process of directing a project (see Chapter 14).

Also, during the initiation stage, the process of managing a stage boundary (see Chapter 18) is used to plan the next stage in detail.\nThe initiation stage ends with the project initiation documentation being reviewed by the project board, again using their own process (directing a project) to decide whether to authorize the project and the next stage to proceed.

Nothing should be done until fundamental information needed to make rational decisions about the commissioning of the project is defined, key roles and responsibilities are resourced and allocated, and a foundation for detailed planning is available.\nThe purpose of the process of starting up a project is as much about preventing poorly conceived ideas from ever being initiated as it is about progressing viable projects for approval.

The aim is to do the minimum necessary to decide whether it is worthwhile to even initiate the project."

In PRINCE2, the trigger for the project is referred to as the project mandate. This is provided by the responsible authority from the business that is commissioning the project. There is also a wide variety of areas where the responsible authority could come from. For example, the project executive group, a functional or operational unit, a programme, a portfolio, or a customer.\nFrom an organizational perspective in PRINCE2, the responsible authority is regarded as being outside the project in the business layer. The term project mandate applies to whatever information is used to trigger the project, such as a feasibility study or the receipt of a request for proposal in a supplier environment. The project mandate should provide the terms of reference for the project and should contain sufficient information to identify at least the prospective project executive of the project board. The information in the project mandate is refined to develop the project brief."

The project brief is prepared for this purpose.\nThe effort involved in starting up a project can vary enormously from project to project. If the project is part of a programme, the programme management team should provide the project brief and will appoint some, if not all, members of the project board, thus eliminating much of the work required in this process. In such cases, the project manager should validate what is provided by the programme and, if necessary, recommend modifications.\nThe preparation of the outline business case and the assembling of the project brief, which are parallel and iterative activities, require regular and frequent interaction and consultation between the project manager, the project board members, and other stakeholders. The more time spent on clearly capturing the requirements during the process of starting up a project, the more time will be saved during project initiation and delivery by avoiding issues, exceptions, and replanning.\nTable 13.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs for starting up a project (Lists Inputs, Activities, and Outputs for starting up a project.)\n13.4.1 Appoint the project executive and project manager\nTo get anything done in the project, a decision-maker with appropriate authority (the project executive), who represents the interests of the business stakeholder, is needed. The appointment of the project executive is a prerequisite to ensuring that the project is justified.\nThe appointment of a project manager allows for the project to be managed on a day-to-day basis on behalf of the project executive. The project executive may need to consult with, and gain agreement from, the business when appointing a project manager.\nRecommended actions:\n● The business reviews the project mandate, checks understanding, and clarifies any ambiguities.\n● The business identifies, selects, and appoints the project executive.\n● The project executive identifies, selects, and appoints the project manager.\n● The project manager creates the daily log as a repository for project information.\n13.4.2 Assess previous lessons\nA number of lessons may have been provided by other projects in the business and external organizations. These lessons may include weaknesses or strengths of the processes and procedures, as well as the techniques and tools used, when they were used, how they were used, and by whom. The design of the project management team, the outline business case, the contents of the project brief, and the stage plan for the initiation stage can be influenced by lessons from previous projects.\nIt may be useful to hold a workshop as a means to capture relevant lessons. Attendees could include any interested parties and people who have worked on previous similar projects. If the business has not done this type of project before, it may be helpful to include people external to the business who have the relevant experience.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review related lessons of similar previous projects of the business and external organizations to identify lessons that can be applied to this project (for example, these may include the results of audits and project reviews).\n● Consult with individuals or teams with experience of similar projects.\n● If appropriate, create the lessons log and record any lessons identified and associated actions.\n13.4.3 Prepare the outline business case\nGiven the information available, the outline business case is likely to be only a high-level view at this time. It provides an agreed foundation for a more detailed business case developed in the process of initiating a project (see Chapter 5).\nRecommended actions:\n● The project executive develops the outline business case in accordance with the project mandate and based on what is currently known about the project. This is in consultation with the senior user if appointed at this time. They will need to understand how the project will contribute towards the business objectives.\n● The project manager consults with the senior user, senior supplier, and project executive to define what the project is to deliver and create the project product description (see Chapter 7).\n● Any risks captured in the daily log are reviewed, and the key risks affecting viability of the project are summarized in the outline business case.\n13.4.4 Appoint the project management team\nThe project needs the right people in place with the authority, responsibility, and knowledge to make decisions in a timely manner. The project management team needs to reflect the interests of all parties who will be involved, including business, user, and supplier interests (see Chapter 6 for a breakdown of the recommended roles within the project management team). It is important that in addition to the authority, responsibility, and knowledge mentioned above, those involved can work together to form a high-performing team (see Chapter 3).\nIt is essential in a well-run project that every individual involved in the management of the project understands and agrees who is accountable to whom for what, who is responsible for what, and what the reporting and communication lines are.\nRecommended actions:\n● The project manager should review the lessons log, design the project management team structure, and prepare role descriptions.\n● The project executive in consultation with the senior user and project manager should identify, select, and appoint the project management team.\n● The project manager should agree team working practices and communication for the initiation stage, and if any risks are identified, add them to the project log.\n13.4.5 Select the project approach\nBefore any planning of the project can be done, questions must be raised regarding how the work of the project is going to be approached:\n● Will the solution be developed in-house or contracted to third parties (often referred to as the delivery model)?\n● Will the solution be a modification to an existing product or built from scratch?\n● Will the solution be based on a commercial off-the-shelf product (often referred to as a COTS product) or something that is custom designed?\n● What delivery methods should be used? For example, can the project product be delivered incrementally, perhaps using agile working methods, or will it need to be delivered in a linear-sequential way?\n● How will the project approach support any sustainability expectations or requirements?\nThe way in which the work is to be conducted will depend on any user or supplier standards, practices, and guidelines (such as any specific delivery methods that may apply). These should be captured in the project brief as part of the project approach, as they will influence the management approaches to be created in the process of initiating a project. Capturing these aspects also ensures that the project approach is clearly understood between the user and the supplier and does not jeopardize the project in any way.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Evaluate the possible delivery solutions and determine the project approach appropriate to delivering the project product and achieving the outline business case.\n● Define any requirements to tailor the method, if known at this time.\n● Use the project log to record any new issues or risks.\n13.4.6 Assemble the project brief\nAn agreed project brief ensures that the project has a commonly understood and well-defined starting point.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Confirm the current status of the project\n● such as the project background and any preparation work performed to date.\n● Confirm the objectives and desired outcomes.\n● Confirm the project scope, exclusions, and project tolerances.\n● Identify any constraints and assumptions.\n● Identify the user and any other known interested parties.\n● Review the project management team structure and role descriptions to identify any additional roles or skills required in the project ecosystem\n● Prepare additional role descriptions as necessary.\n● Identify the dependencies with other projects or activities that the project must maintain.\n● Document the above in the project brief (see Chapter 5).\n● Use the project log to record any new issues or risks.\n13.4.7 Plan the initiation stage\nInitiating a project takes time and consumes resources. The work should be planned and approved to ensure that initiation is not aimless and unstructured. If the project is part of a programme, the end date for the initiation stage should be checked against the date defined in the programme’s plans. The stage plan for the initiation stage will also give the programme management team warning of any requirements from the programme.\nThe application of PRINCE2 processes during the initiation stage needs to be considered as part of the process of starting up a project. For example, the project may choose to apply the controlling a stage and managing product delivery processes during the process of initiating a project.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Decide suitable management controls for the initiation stage activities, based on the project approach.\n● Identify any constraints on time and costs for the initiation stage and produce the stage plan for this stage according to the principles and techniques in Chapter 7.\n● Review any risks in the project log and assess their impact on the stage plan for the initiation stage. If any new risks are identified (or existing ones have changed), update the project log.\n13.4.8 Request project initiation\nTo finish the process of starting up a project, the project manager contacts the project board to request project initiation. The formal justification in the outline business case and project brief is presented to the project board.\nRecommended actions:\n● Brief the project board on the outline business case, project product, project approach, the project management team appointments, and initiation stage activities and controls.\n● Formally request authority from the project board to initiate the project to secure the people and resources required."

It is also important that levels of authority and decision-making processes are clearly defined and empower the project manager and team managers.\nThere needs to be a two-way flow of information between the project board and the business layer during the project. The project board must ensure that the project always remains aligned with the business layer’s strategy.\nA key role of the project board is to engage with the business layer and act as a communication channel. The requirement for the project board to act as a communication channel, and how it is going to do this should be documented in the communication management approach.\nThe project board should provide unified direction and guidance to the project manager. If the project board is unable to provide a single view, then the risk of project failure significantly increases, as the project manager may act on contradictory requirements and priorities. In such cases, the project executive makes the decision.\nThe process of directing a project provides a mechanism for the project board to meet its responsibility for ensuring there is continued business justification without being overburdened by hands-on project management activity. It also provides a mechanism to avoid the project board micromanaging the project manager.\nOne of the functions of the project board is to provide informal advice and guidance as well as formal direction to the project manager. This is two-way, with the project board updating the project manager on matters external to the project and the project manager seeking advice whenever necessary during the course of the project."

      "content": "Table 14.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs for directing a project (Lists Inputs, Activities, and Outputs for directing a project, covering authorizing initiation, the project, stages/exceptions, ongoing direction, and closure.)\n14.4.1 Authorize initiation\nProjects take time and cost money to initiate, so the activities for initiation should be planned, monitored, and controlled. The project board activity to authorize initiation ensures such investment is worthwhile.\nWhen a request to initiate a project is received from the project manager (following the process of starting up a project), the project board must decide whether to allow the project to proceed to the initiation stage. This may be done either with or without a formal project board meeting or without a formal meeting, as long as all members are in agreement, and the project manager is given documented instruction from the project executive to proceed with initiation. The project board may delegate project assurance by instructing a person or group to undertake some of the reviewing and assessing actions (such as inspecting the initiation stage plan to confirm it is viable). Where project assurance activities are delegated, the project board remains accountable.\nRecommended actions for the project board:\n● Check that the project approach aligns with business policies.\n● Review and approve the project brief and the project product description.\n● Check that the outline business case demonstrates a viable project that aligns to business strategy.\n● Review and approve the stage plan for the initiation stage. Set tolerances for the stage.\n● Inform all stakeholders and the impacted sites that the project is being initiated and request any necessary logistical support (such as communication facilities, equipment, and any project support) sufficient for the initiation stage.\n● Authorize the project manager to proceed with the initiation stage.\n14.4.2 Authorize the project\nThis activity will be triggered by a request from the project manager for authorization to deliver the project and may be undertaken in parallel with authorizing a stage or exception plan (see section 14.4.4).\nThe objective of authorizing the project is to decide whether to proceed with the rest of the project. The project board has to confirm that:\n● A robust business case exists, and it shows a viable project.\n● The project plan and the benefits management approach demonstrate the project is able to deliver the business case.\n● The management approaches and controls support delivery of the project plan.\nIf the project is not authorized by the project board, then it should be prematurely closed (see Chapter 19).\nThe project board may delegate project assurance by instructing a person or group to undertake some of the reviewing and assessing actions, such as inspecting the communication management approach to confirm all stakeholders are covered. Where project assurance activities are delegated, the project board remains accountable.\nRecommended actions for the project board:\n● review and approve the project initiation documentation\n● confirm tolerances for the project\n● confirm that lessons from previous similar projects have been reviewed and addressed\n● confirm that there has been a review of the risks and that risk responses for both threats and opportunities are appropriate and planned\n● obtain or commit the people and resources needed by the project (these will be provided to the project manager stage by stage)\n● notify the business and other interested parties that the project has been authorized\n● authorize the project manager to deliver the project or instruct the project manager to close the project prematurely if a decision is made not to proceed.\n14.4.3 Give ongoing direction\nProject board members must offer informal guidance or respond to requests for advice at any time during a project. The need for consultation between the project manager and project board is likely to be especially frequent during the initiation stage and when approaching stage boundaries.\nOngoing direction may be given collectively or by individual project board members. There are a variety of circumstances that trigger ongoing direction, including:\n● general advice on the project (for example, explaining the business’ sustainability objectives and ESG reporting requirements relevant to the project)\n● responding to requests (for example, when options need clarifying or where areas of conflict need resolving)\n● responding to reports (for example, highlight reports, exception reports, and issue reports)\n● responding to external influences (such as changes in business priorities)\n● project board members’ individual concerns\n● responding to changes in project board composition (which may also require business approval).\nIf an exception has occurred during the stage, the project board may request that the project manager produces an exception plan for the project board’s approval. Only exceptions to stage plans need to be escalated for approval by the project board; deviations from the project plan need business approval. Work package level exceptions are managed by the project manager using the process of controlling a stage (see Chapter 16). If approved, the exception plan will replace the plan that is in exception and will become the new baselined plan.\nIt is also possible that the business revises the project mandate in response to events external to the project or instructs the project board to close the project. The project board has two primary options should the business decide to change the project mandate:\n● Treat it as a request for change (see Chapter 10), asking the project manager to replan the stage or project.\n● Stop, trigger a premature close (see Chapter 19), and then start a new project to meet the changed project mandate. This may result in additional costs compared with the request-for-change option.\nThe project board may delegate project assurance by instructing a person or group to undertake some of the reviewing and assessing actions, such as inspecting a request for change to confirm that the impact has been adequately assessed. Where project assurance activities are delegated, the project board remains accountable. When making decisions, it is important to consider the impact on all stakeholders (as identified in the communication management approach).\nRecommended actions for the project board:\n● In response to informal requests for advice and guidance, seek advice (if needed) and assist the project manager.\n● In response to an escalated issue (see Chapter 10), seek advice (if needed) and make a decision. If the issue is off-specification then the response is either to reject it, which means the project management team or supplier will need to complete the relevant product, or to grant a concession, which means the incomplete product is accepted.\n● In response to an exception report (see Chapter 11), seek advice (if needed) and make a decision.\n● In response to the receipt of a highlight report (see Chapter 11), review and take actions as necessary.\n● In response to advice and decisions from the business, notify the project manager of any changes.\n14.4.4 Authorize a stage or exception plan\nIt is important that a stage starts only when the project board says it should. The project board authorizes a stage by reviewing the performance of the current stage and approving the stage plan for the next stage. Approval of stage plans occurs prior to every stage.\nThe project board delegate project assurance by instructing a person or group to undertake some of the reviewing and assessing actions, such as inspecting the stage plan to confirm it is viable. Where project assurance activities are delegated, the project board remains accountable.\nRecommended actions for the project board:\n● Review and approve the end stage report.\n● Review the stage plan or exception plan for which the project manager is seeking approval.\n● Make a decision to approve the plan or ask the project manager to revise the rejected plan, or instruct the project manager to initiate premature closure of the project.\n● Communicate the status of the project to the business and keep other interested parties informed about project progress (in accordance with the communication management approach).\n14.4.5 Authorize project closure\nThe controlled close of a project is as important as the controlled start. There must be a point when the objectives in the original and current versions of the project initiation documentation and project plan are assessed in order to understand:\n● whether the objectives have been achieved\n● how the project has deviated from its initial basis\n● that the project has nothing more to contribute.\nWithout this approach, there is a risk that the project fails to close down in a controlled way without completing the handover to the business, and the original focus on benefits will be lost. There is a risk that the team is not fully released for new work.\nAuthorizing closure of the project is the last activity undertaken by the project board, prior to its own disbandment, and may require endorsement from the business. The project board may request project assurance to undertake some of the reviewing and assessing actions, such as inspecting the end project report to confirm it is accurate.\nRecommended actions for the project board:\n● Review the original and current versions of the project initiation documentation to understand the project’s initial baseline and current approaches and controls.\n● Review and approve the end project report.\n● Ensure that post-project benefits reviews defined by the updated benefits management approach cover the performance of the project product in operational use in order to identify whether there have been any side effects (beneficial or adverse).\n● Review and gain approval for the updated benefits management approach, ensuring that it addresses the expected benefits that cannot yet be confirmed. (As the benefits management approach includes resources beyond the life of the project, responsibility for the approach needs to be transferred to the business.)\n● Confirm the updated business case by comparing the actual and forecast benefits, costs, and risks against the outline business case that was used to justify the project (it may not be possible to confirm all the benefits as some will not be realized until after the project is closed).\n● Review and issue a project closure notification in accordance with the communication management approach. The project board advises those who have provided the support infrastructure and resources for the project that these can be withdrawn. This should indicate a closing date for costs being charged to the project.\n● Ensure that off-boarding of all remaining project team members is handled in a correct way (see Chapter 3)."

      "content": "The process of initiating a project enables the project board, via the process of directing a project (see Chapter 14), to decide whether or not the project is sufficiently aligned with the business objectives to justify its continuation.\nIn the process of initiating a project, the project manager will be creating the suite of management products required for the level of control specified by the project board. The project manager should have agreed with the project board how they will review and approve the management products. For example, should they review each management product as they become ready or wait until the full suite of management products are ready to review as a set?\nAll activities within the process of initiating a project need further consideration if the relationship between the user and the supplier is a commercial one, as the risks, rewards, and reasons for undertaking the project will be different for the user (as the customer) and the supplier.\nTable 15.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs for initiating a project (Lists Inputs, Activities, and Outputs for initiating a project.)\n15.4.1 Agree tailoring requirements\nThe project manager may need to tailor PRINCE2 to recognize the internal and external factors that affect the way in which the project is delivered. The business may already have a standard project management framework, based on a tailored version of PRINCE2, ready to apply to the project. How PRINCE2 or the business’ standard project management framework will be applied and/or tailored must be documented and agreed.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review the project brief to understand the outlined tailoring approach (if defined).\n● Seek lessons on how to apply tailoring from similar previous projects, businesses, and external organizations.\n● Define any tailoring requirements as part of the project initiation documentation including any related project controls.\n● Consult with project assurance to check that any proposed tailoring will meet the needs of the project board or business.\n● Seek the project board’s approval for any tailoring (although the project board may prefer to review it later as part of the project initiation documentation).\n15.4.2 Agree the management approaches\nThe activities to establish the approaches for the project may be executed in parallel, but it is recommended that the communication management approach is completed last, as it will need to include the communications required by the other approaches.\nThe management approaches are derived from business strategies, standards, or practices that the project needs to comply with and the users’ quality and sustainability expectations captured in the project product description. When the approaches have been defined, it is possible to establish the project controls and create the project plan. The nine different management approaches are:\n● change management approach (see Chapter 3)\n● communication management approach (see Chapter 3)\n● sustainability management approach (see Chapter 5)\n● benefits management approach (see Chapter 5)\n● commercial management approach (see Chapter 6)\n● quality management approach (see Chapter 8)\n● risk management approach (see Chapter 9)\n● issue management approach (see Chapter 10)\n● digital and data management approach (see Chapter 11).\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review how PRINCE2 will be tailored and its implications for the management approaches.\n● Review the project brief to understand whether any business strategies, standards, or practices relating to management approaches need to be applied during the project (including any that are contractual requirements).\n● Seek lessons related to the management approaches from similar previous projects, business, and external organizations. (Some of these may already have been captured in the project log.)\n● Review the project log for any issues and risks related to the management approaches.\n● Update the project log if any new risks or issues are identified (or existing ones have changed).\n● Consult with project assurance to check that the proposed management approaches meet the needs of the project board or business.\n● Seek the project board’s approval for the management approaches (although the project board may prefer to review them later as part of the project initiation documentation).\n15.4.3 Establish project controls\nThe level of control required by the project board after initiation needs to be agreed, and the mechanism for such controls needs to be established, as does the level of control required by the project manager of the work to be undertaken by team managers. Project controls enable the project to be managed in an effective and efficient manner that is consistent with the scale, risks, complexity, and importance of the project.\nEffective project controls are a prerequisite for managing by exception. Project controls can include:\n● the frequency and format of communication between and within the project management layers (see Chapter 6)\n● the number of stages (see Chapter 7)\n● mechanisms to capture and analyse issues (see Chapter 10)\n● setting tolerances for delegated authority (see Chapter 10)\n● how delegated authority from one level of management to another will be monitored (see Chapter 11)\n● mechanisms to escalate exceptions (see Chapter 11).\nMany of these controls would have been defined in the management approaches but not necessarily established. The focus of this activity is to establish such controls and to make sure that they make sense as a coherent set.\nRecommended actions for the project manager and project support:\n● Confirm the delivery method (linear-sequential, iterative-incremental, hybrid), and assess its implications for project controls.\n● Review how PRINCE2 will be tailored and included in the project initiation documentation and its implications for project controls.\n● Review the management approaches to identify which controls need to be established.\n● Actively seek lessons related to project controls from similar previous projects, business, and external organizations: some may have been captured in the project log.\n● Review the project log for risks and issues associated with project controls. (The aggregated set of risks will have an impact on the scale and rigour of control activities.)\n● Confirm and document the stage boundaries required to provide the appropriate level of control.\n● Allocate the various levels of decision-making required within the project to the most appropriate project management level.\n● Establish any decision-making procedures that may be appropriate, possibly by tailoring procedures within an existing quality management system or other standard procedures.\n● Build the agreed decision-making authority and responsibility into the project management team structure and role descriptions where appropriate; this may include finalizing any roles not previously allocated, reallocating roles previously filled and, if necessary, redesigning the project management team to include all needed stakeholders and to build a coherent team (see Chapter 3 and Chapter 6).\n● Confirm the tolerances for the project and the escalation procedures (from team managers to project manager, project manager to project board, and project board to business).\n● Summarize the project controls in the project initiation documentation.\n● Consult with project assurance to check that the proposed project controls are consistent with the nature of the project and meet the needs of the project board or business.\n● Update the project log if any new risks or issues are identified (or existing ones have changed).\n● Seek the project board’s approval for the project controls (the board may review them later as part of the project initiation documentation).\n15.4.4 Prepare the project plan\nBefore committing to major expenditure on the project, the timescale, resource, and people requirements must be established. This information is held in the project plan and is needed so that the benefits management approach can be prepared, and the project board can control the project.\nPlanning is not an activity that the project manager performs in isolation but something that should be done with close involvement of the users and suppliers to co-create the project plan. It is often useful to hold planning workshops to help identify all the products required, their details, and the dependencies between them.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Confirm the delivery method (linear-sequential, iterative-incremental, hybrid), and assess its implications for planning.\n● Review the project brief to understand scope and any planning requirements.\n● Review how PRINCE2 will be tailored for the project and included in the project initiation documentation and its implications for planning.\n● Seek lessons related to planning from similar previous projects, business, and external organizations. (Some of these may already have been captured in the project log.)\n● Review the project log for risks and issues associated with planning.\n● Identify any planning and control tools to be used by the project, and document how they will be used in the project plan.\n● Choose the methods of estimating for the project’s plans.\n● Review the management approaches to understand the resources, standards, methods, and costs for the work to be performed.\n● Create a product breakdown structure for the project product and its major components, write product descriptions for these, and devise a product flow diagram (include them all in the project plan).\n● Identify the arrangements for the transition of the project product into operational use. (If the project product is likely to require maintenance when operational, then plan for a suitable service agreement should be drawn up between the support group and the user; in such instances, it will be necessary to include any agreement as a product in the project plan.)\n● Consider whether the project product description needs to be updated (for example, if the understanding of the acceptance criteria has changed or been refined in the course of initiating the project).\n● Create or update the product register records in the project log for each product to be delivered by the plan.\n● Identify and confirm people and resources required.\n● Confirm the selected people’s availability, their acceptance of these roles, and their commitment to execute them (see Chapter 6 for more details).\n● Identify the activities, resources, people, and timings for the project controls and include them in the plan.\n● Document and decide the format and presentation of the project plan, bearing in mind the audience for the plan and how it will be used (for example, it may be sufficient to use a product checklist for presenting the plan to the project board). (See the product description for a plan in Appendix A, section A10, for more information.)\n● Consult with project assurance to check that the proposed project plan meets the needs of the project board or business.\n● Update the project log if any new risks or issues are identified (or existing ones have changed).\n● Seek the project board’s approval for the project plan (although the project board may prefer to review it later as part of the project initiation documentation).\n15.4.5 Prepare the full business case\nThe outline business case produced during starting up a project needs to be updated to reflect the estimated time and costs, as determined by the project plan, and the aggregated risks from the updated project log.\nPreparing the full business case is not an activity that the project manager performs in isolation but something that should be done with close involvement of the project executive to co-create the business case. The full business case will be used by the project board to authorize the project and provides the basis of the ongoing check that the project remains viable. (For more details on business justification, see Chapter 5.)\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review the project brief to check whether there are any business requirements for the format and content of a business case.\n● Seek lessons related to business case development from similar previous projects, business, and external organizations. (Some of these may already have been captured in the project log.)\n● Create a more detailed business case with the additional detail gained.\n● Update the project log if any new risks or issues are identified (or existing ones have changed).\n● Consult with project assurance to check that the proposed business case meets the needs of the project board or business.\n● Seek the project board’s approval for the business case (although the project board may prefer to review them later as part of the project initiation documentation).\n15.4.6 Assemble the project initiation documentation\nThere needs to be a focal point at which all information relating to the what, why, who, how, where, when, and how much of the project is:\n● gathered for agreement by the key stakeholders\n● available for guidance and information for those involved in the project.\nThis information is collated in the project initiation documentation. The project initiation documentation is an aggregation of many of the management products created or updated during initiation and used to gain authorization for the project to proceed. It is not necessarily a single document but a collection of documents or other forms of information (such as a workbook or contents of a project management tool).\nThe version of the project initiation documentation created during the process of initiating a project and used to gain authorization for the project to proceed must be baselined and should be placed under change control. It will be used later as a means to compare the project’s actual performance against the original forecasts that formed the basis of approval.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Extract and, if necessary, revise information from the project brief.\n● Include or reference information in the: project’s management team structure and role descriptions, business case, management approaches, project plan.\n● Include or reference the project controls and summarize how the project has tailored PRINCE2.\n● Assemble the project initiation documentation.\n● Perform a cross-check of the information in the various elements to ensure that they are compatible.\n● Consult with project assurance to check that the assembled project initiation documentation meets the needs of the project board or business.\n● Prepare for the next stage (which triggers the managing a stage boundary process).\n15.4.7 Request project authorization\nTo finish the process of initiating a project, hence the initiation stage, the project manager contacts the project board to request project authorization. The formal justification can be found in the business case and the project initiation documentation.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Share the final version of the business case, the project initiation documentation, and the project plan with the project board.\n● Formally request authority from the project board to deliver the project to secure the people and resources required."

For this reason, it is better to start simple and then elaborate if needed, rather than creating a management environment suitable for a hypothetical major project.\nSome projects are too complex to have a full definition of the project’s output (and hence a project’s final products) agreed by the end of this process.

      "content": "The day-to-day control of the work conducted is central to the ultimate success of the project. Throughout a stage, this will consist of a cycle of:\n● authorizing work\n● monitoring progress information about that work, including accepting completed work packages\n● reviewing the situation, including that for product quality, and triggering new work packages\n● reporting highlights to the project board at an agreed frequency\n● observing, assessing, and handling issues and risks\n● taking any necessary corrective action to remain within tolerances.\nTowards the end of the last stage, the process of closing a project will be triggered (Chapter 19).\nTable 16.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs for controlling a stage (Lists Inputs, Activities, and Outputs for controlling a stage.)\n16.4.1 Authorize a work package\nThe degree of autonomy people require to deliver project work needs to be balanced with the need to coordinate timing of when work starts and by when work should be completed. Project work should only commence and continue with the consent of the project manager. Otherwise, the working environment would be chaotic if people started performing activities whenever they chose. The vehicle for ensuring the coordinated timing of project work is the authorization, execution, and delivery of a work package.\nA work package should cover the work to create one or more products. If a product requires more than one work package to create it, then it should be broken down into further sub-products with their supporting product descriptions.\nThe triggers for the project manager to authorize a work package include the following actions:\n● Stage authorization The project board gives authority to execute a stage plan.\n● Exception plan approved The project board gives authority to execute an exception plan.\n● New work package required An output is derived from evaluate stage status (see section 16.4.4).\n● Corrective action It is taken in response to an issue or risk.\nThis activity is used to authorize new work packages or to authorize amendments to existing ones.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Examine the project initiation documentation and the stage plan to determine the work packages required.\n● Define each work package to be authorized (or amended).\n● Build a working relationship with the team manager (see Chapter 3).\n● Co-create and review the work package description with the team manager, confirm they have accepted it, and authorize the team manager to begin work (see Chapter 17). For projects using an iterative-incremental delivery method, the co-creation of the work package description may be a joint exercise with the team manager, development team, and product owner.\n● Review the team manager’s team plan (if the commercial environment means it is inappropriate for the project manager to see its contents, use the milestone extract from it) and update the stage plan to reflect the timing of the work packages authorized.\n● Update the project log to reflect the content of the work packages authorized.\n● Update the project log for planned quality management activities.\n● Consult with project assurance that the identified and selected quality reviewers are acceptable.\n● If necessary, update the project log in accordance with the management approaches.\n16.4.2 Evaluate work package status\nThis activity provides the means for regular assessment of the status of the work package. The frequency and formality of this activity will usually be aligned with the frequency of reporting defined in the work package description and supported by the stage plan for the current stage.\nRecommended actions for the project manager for each work package in progress:\n● Have informal conversations with the team manager to maintain the relationship (see Chapter 3), and understand any issues or risks they may have with their work package.\n● Collect and review progress information from the checkpoint report for the work package being executed.\n● If necessary, update the project log.\n● Update the stage plan for the current stage with actuals to date, forecasts, and adjustments.\n16.4.3 Receive completed work package\nWhen work has been allocated to individuals or teams, there should be a matching confirmation that the work has been completed and approved.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Ensure that the team manager has completed the work defined by the work package description, or, if an agile approach is being used, they have delivered the features agreed for the timebox.\n● Check the quality register relating to the product to determine if the necessary quality reviews are completed.\n● Ensure that each product in the work package has gained its requisite approval (as defined in the quality and sustainability responsibilities in their product descriptions).\n● Confirm that the product register record for each approved product has been updated.\n● Update the stage plan to show the work package as completed.\n16.4.4 Evaluate stage status\nThere is a danger that the stage will get out of control if it is not checked on a timely basis. There must be a balance between planning ahead and reacting to events.\nTo make informed decisions and exercise rational control, it is necessary to compare what has actually happened with what was expected to happen and what might happen next (including any issues and risks).\nIt is therefore essential to have a steady flow of information that provides an overall view of progress and simple, robust monitoring systems to supply that information.\nThe objective of this activity is to maintain an accurate and current picture of progress on the work performed and the status of resources. The activity occurs at a frequency defined in the stage plan, may be triggered by the project board’s advice, or forms part of the analysis of new issues and risks.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review progress for the stage, and decide whether any actions are required.\n● Revise the project log as necessary.\n● Update the stage plan if the aggregated assessment changes any forecasts.\n● Confirm if ownership of any of the products has been transferred to the users as part of a phased handover of the products (see Chapter 19). (Note that there may be multiple handovers throughout the project lifecycle.)\n● Consider whether to review lessons now or wait until either a later review of stage status or when approaching a stage end.\n● Prepare the next stage if the end of the current stage is approaching, as indicated by, for example, the stage plan, the contents of the project log, or a milestone (see Chapter 18).\n● Prepare to close the project if the end of the final stage is approaching (see Chapter 19).\n16.4.5 Capture issues and risks\nIn the course of managing the project, issues will most likely occur, and risks may be identified. They will occur in an unstructured way and should be captured in a consistent and reliable manner. Any member of the business, project, or other stakeholders may raise an issue or risk. In addition, it is extremely important to ensure psychological safety within the project management team (see Chapter 3). Related issues and risks will have to be addressed immediately and adequately.\nBefore making a decision on a course of action, each issue or risk should be registered in the project log and then assessed for its impact.\nFor more details on risk management, see Chapter 9; for more details on issue management, see Chapter 10.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● In the case of a risk, log and manage the risk in accordance with the risk management approach (see Chapter 9).\n● In the case of an issue, log and manage the issue in accordance with the issue management approach (see Chapter 10).\n● If it is necessary to take corrective action, seek advice from the project board or escalate an issue or risk. Thereafter, review the stage status first so that an overall view can be considered (see section 16.4.4).\n16.4.6 Take corrective action\nEven when changes and adjustments to the project appear to be easily manageable and within tolerances, they must be made in a consistent and rational way.\nBy taking corrective action, the objective is to select and implement actions that will resolve deviations from the plan (within the limits of the stage and project tolerances). Corrective action is triggered while evaluating the stage status (section 16.4.4) and typically involves handling advice and guidance received from the project board and issues raised by team managers.\nFor more details on planning, see Chapter 7; for more details on issue management, see Chapter 10.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Collect any relevant information about the deviation.\n● Identify potential solutions for the deviation, and select the most appropriate option.\n● Trigger corrective action via authorizing a work package (see section 16.4.1).\n● Update the product register records of the affected products, including whether any changes are required or new products are required.\n● Update the issue report (if necessary) to show the status of the corrective action.\n● Update the project log with any changes resulting from the corrective action.\n● Update the stage plan for the current stage.\n16.4.7 Escalate issues and risks\nA stage should not exceed the tolerances agreed with the project board. The project manager can only take corrective action or maintain the status quo as long as the stage (or project) is forecast to be completed within the tolerances set by the project board. This activity applies where any corrective action within the project manager’s control would not save the stage from going beyond the tolerances agreed. This applies to all types of issue and risk (or aggregations of them) that cannot be resolved within the tolerances set by the project board.\nAs it may take some time to gather the information to create an exception report, it is recommended to alert the project board as early as possible. Therefore, the project manager may wish to execute this activity in two steps: an early notification of the forecast exception situation to the project board so that they are prepared, followed by the supporting information in an exception report.\nThe project manager should execute any decision by the project board in response to the escalation. Escalating issues and risks is good practice and should not be seen as failure; the earlier that issues are escalated, the more time is available to implement any corrective actions.\nFor more details on management of risk, see Chapter 9; for more details on issue management, see Chapter 10; for more details on exception management, see Chapter 11.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Examine the stage plan to define the extent of the deviation and the unfinished products and to determine what would happen if the deviation was allowed to continue.\n● Understand the psychological safety within the project management team to decide if actions are required.\n● Examine the project plan for the project status and the overall effect of any deviation (using the current baseline of the project initiation documentation).\n● Determine the options for recovery, and assess them against the business case.\n● Assess the impact of the options for recovery against the stage plan for the current stage. (Consideration should be given to the availability of individuals or groups with the skills or experience to assess the impact.)\n● Put the situation, options, and the recommendation for a course of action to the project board in an exception report; the project board will then decide an appropriate course of action (which may support or otherwise reject the project manager’s recommendation).\n16.4.8 Report highlights\nThe project manager must provide the project board with summary information about the status of the stage and project and distribute other information to the stakeholders at a frequency documented in the communication management approach, as defined by the project board. (See Chapter 11 for more details on progress controls.)\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Assemble the information from the checkpoint reports, project log, and any significant revisions to the stage plan for the current reporting period (the information is gained from the review of the stage status; see section 16.4.4).\n● Assemble a list of corrective actions (as noted or recorded in the project log) undertaken during the reporting period; this will assure the project board that the project manager is acting within the agreed tolerances (the information is gained from taking corrective action; see section 16.4.6).\n● Review the highlight report for the previous reporting period.\n● Produce the highlight report for the current reporting period.\n● Distribute the highlight report (see Chapter 11). For projects using an iterative-incremental delivery method such as agile, the highlight report may be based on a ‘pull’ system, whereby the project board looks at progress charts being maintained by the project manager and development teams."

It is good practice to include extracts from, or simply make cross-reference to elements of, the project plan, stage plan, or project initiation documentation. This can reduce duplicate content.\nThe relationship between the project manager, project support, and team managers during the controlling a stage process should be collaborative. The project manager is not delegating or assigning tasks to team managers or project support but rather facilitating the process to improve ownership and enable the team manager and project support to deliver their contribution to the project, and ultimately, the business objectives (see Chapter 3 on co-creation and collaboration)."

Hence, they will rely on the team manager or other specialists to create the content, and the project manager’s role will be to ensure that they are defined, reviewed, and assured sufficiently to meet the needs of the stage plan."

The process of controlling a stage views it from the project manager’s perspective.\nThe team manager ensures that the team creates and delivers products during the project by:\n● accepting authorized work packages from the project manager\n● ensuring that the development, operations, and maintenance relationships identified in the work package description are maintained\n● creating a team plan for the assigned work packages (this may be done in parallel with the project manager creating the stage plan for the stage)\n● ensuring that the products are developed in accordance with any development methods specified in the work package description\n● demonstrating that each product meets its quality criteria through the quality methods specified in the product description\n● obtaining approval for completed products from the authorities identified in the product description\n● delivering the products to the project manager in accordance with any procedures specified in the work package description.\nSometimes a project uses external suppliers that do not use PRINCE2. The process of managing product delivery provides a statement of the required working relationship between the team manager and the project’s PRINCE2 method by the project manager. The work package may be part of a contractual agreement; therefore, the formality of a team plan could vary from simply appending a schedule to the work package description to creating a fully formed plan that is presented in a style similar to a stage plan."

This should cover the reporting requirements, the constraints that apply, any procedures to be applied, and whether the requirements of the work package are reasonable and can be achieved.\nRecommended actions for each team manager:\n● Review the work package description to understand what is to be delivered and when.\n● Produce a team plan to show which products can be completed within the given constraints. For example, within the timebox when using an agile approach.\n● Check the work package description for the procedure to update the project log.\n● Consult with project assurance as to whether any extra reviewers are required for each product, and ensure the project log is updated accordingly.\n● Consult with project assurance (supplier) to confirm that the team plan is viable and in accordance with the relevant supplier standards.\n● Seek necessary approval for the team plan (note that in a commercial customer-supplier relationship, it may be inappropriate for the project manager to review and approve the team plan, and in this context, the senior supplier may review and approve the team plans).\n● Undertake a review of the risks against the team plan, and advise the project manager of any additional or modified risks, and if the work package description allows the team manager to directly log the risks, the team manager should update the project log.\n● Agree to deliver the work package.\n17.4.2 Execute a work package\nThe work must be executed and monitored in accordance with the requirements defined in the authorized work package.\nThe team manager can only proceed with the work package or take corrective action when the work package is forecast to be completed within the tolerances set by the project manager. As soon as work package tolerances are expected to be exceeded, the team manager should raise an issue with the project manager. They will then choose a course of action.\nIn addition, it is extremely important to ensure psychological safety within the team (see Chapter 3). Related issues and risks will have to be addressed immediately and adequately.\nRecommended actions for each team manager:\n● Manage the development of the required products in accordance with the requirements defined in the work package description and any specific arrangements in the agreed team plan.\n● Notify the project manager of any new issues, risks, or lessons, and take any action required by the project manager.\n● Notify the project manager of the completed quality activities, and update the quality register.\n● Obtain approvals for any completed products, and update the product register.\n17.4.3 Evaluate a work package\nThe team manager should review and report progress to the project manager for each period defined in the work package description.\nRecommended actions:\n● Review the work package description and team plan to confirm expected progress for the period.\n● Review the issue register for any issues associated with the work package.\n● Review the risk register for any risks associated with the work package.\n● Review the quality register for the status of the quality activities associated with the work package.\n● Review the product register for the status of the products associated with the work package, including any approval records.\n● Review the lessons log for any lessons associated with the work package.\n● Report the status of the work package to the project manager via a checkpoint report. For projects using an iterative-incremental delivery method such as agile, the checkpoint report may be based on a ‘pull’ system, whereby the project manager looks at progress charts such as Kanban boards or burn-down charts being maintained by the team manager and development teams.\nIn a commercial context where the team manager is from a supplier organization, they may have their own logs and registers distinct from the project log which they will use to evaluate their work package. Project support may also assist the team manager with their review by providing any information relating to their work package held in the project log.\n17.4.4 Notify work package completion\nJust as the work package authorization was accepted by the team manager from the project manager, notification of its completion must be communicated to the project manager.\nRecommended actions for each team manager:\n● Check the work package description, and follow the procedure to deliver the completed products.\n● Review the approval records to check that all the products to be delivered by the work package are approved.\n● Update the team plan to show that the work package is complete.\n● Review the project log for any lessons and outstanding issues or risks associated with the work package.\n● Brief the project manager on the status of delivered products and the performance of the work against the agreements in the work package description, highlighting any outstanding issues (for example, off-specifications) or risks relating to the completed products.\n● Notify the project manager that the work package is complete."

However, care should be taken to ensure the integrity of the connection to the controlling a stage process.\nAs specialist work is undertaken in this process, work will be completed using delivery methods and techniques that are appropriate to the type of work. It is therefore important that monitoring and control of specialist work uses controls and measures that are appropriate to the methods and techniques being used. The project manager and team manager should agree with such controls, include them in the work package description, and ensure that they are compatible with the management approaches established for the project.\nWork packages are not necessarily small in scale. All the PRINCE2 principles are as applicable to a work package as to a project, requiring appropriate governance and control and often needing a team manager who is skilled in project management.\nFor large work packages, a team manager may create a hierarchy of smaller work packages to allocate to the team members.

Closure activities should be planned as part of the stage plan for the final stage.\nPlanning is not an activity undertaken in isolation. The project manager will need to consult with the project board, project assurance, team managers, and possibly other stakeholders to create a viable plan. The more the people involved in planning, the more robust the plan, provided that the right people are involved. (See Chapter 7 for more details on planning.)\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review the components of the project initiation documentation, and update if necessary. Check for any planning requirements, for example, from the management approaches. It may be necessary to consult with the project board regarding any required changes.\n● Review the lessons log for lessons to apply to the next stage.\n● Review the project plan for any milestones applicable to the stage.\n● Produce the stage plan for the next stage.\n● Produce product descriptions for products to be delivered in the next stage.\n● Create or update product register records for products planned to be produced in the next stage.\n● Update the project log if any new issues or risks have been identified (or if existing ones need to be modified).\n● Update the quality register for planned quality management activities.

Check for any planning requirements, for example, from the management approaches. It may be necessary to consult with the project board regarding any required changes.\n● Review the lessons log for lessons to apply to the exception plan.\n● Review the project plan for any milestones applicable to the exception plan.\n● Produce the exception plan.\n● Produce or update product descriptions for products to be delivered in the next stage.\n● Create or update product register records for products to be produced by the exception plan.\n● Update the project log if any new issues or risks have been identified or if existing ones need to be modified.\n● Update the project log for planned quality management activities.

Details of any revised costs or end dates are used when updating the business case. (See Chapter 7 for more details on planning.)\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Check that the current stage plan is up to date with actual progress, and update it if necessary.\n● Revise the project plan.\n● Update the project log if any new issues or risks have been identified or if existing ones need to be modified.\n18.4.4 Update the business case\nIt is a PRINCE2 principle that a project must ensure continued business justification.\nThe project board is ordinarily only authorized to continue while the project remains viable; the benefits will be realized within the time, cost, quality, scope, risk, and sustainability parameters established in the currently agreed business case.\nProjects do not take place in a static environment. The environment external to the project changes as does the development of the project product. Therefore, the business case needs to reflect these changes and must be reviewed and amended to keep it relevant to the project.\nAs the project executive is accountable for the business case, the project manager should consult with them when reviewing and updating the business case in preparation for the project board’s approval. (See Chapter 5 for more details on business justification.)\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Check whether there have been any changes to the risk appetite and risk capacity of the organizations involved and whether risk tolerances need to be redefined.\n● Assess the project’s risks using the project log to ascertain the aggregated risk exposure for the project, and identify the current key risks that affect the business case. This should include an assessment that the aggregated risk exposure remains within risk tolerances.\n● Update the benefits management approach with the results from any benefits management actions undertaken during the stage.\n● Examine and review the project plan to see whether the final implementation date of the project has changed to an earlier or later date, which might affect some or all of the projected benefits.\n● Check and update the project log as necessary.\n● Revise the business case and, if necessary, the benefits management approach, ready for the project board’s approval.\n18.4.5 Evaluate the stage\nThe results of a stage should be reported back to the project board so that progress is clearly visible to the project management team.\nThe project manager gives a view on the continuing ability of the project to meet the project plan and business case and assesses the overall risk situation. This activity should happen as close as possible to the actual end of a stage.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Based on the performance of the stage using the updated business case, updated project plan, project logs, and any updated management approaches, prepare an end stage report for the current stage.\n● Review the lessons logged to date and include them in the end stage report. This is particularly important for longer projects where interim reviews of lessons (or the project itself) may benefit the business.\n● Review the communication management approach to see whether there is a requirement to send copies of the end stage report (and, if appropriate, a lessons report) to the interested external parties.\n18.4.6 Request the next stage\nThe project manager contacts the project board to request to finish the current stage and to proceed to the next stage. The formal justification can be found in the end stage report and the next stage plan or the exception plan.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Brief the project board about the performance of the current stage, an overview of the next stage, and the people and resources required, and confirm readiness to proceed. The project manager should also confirm where there have been concessions for any off-specifications during the stage.\n● Seek approval from the project board for the exception plan or stage plan and, if appropriate, the revised project plan, the revised benefits management approach, and the revised business case (see Chapter 14). If the project board does not approve the exception plan, then the current stage continues in accordance with the project board direction until a revised exception plan is approved.\n● Request authority from the project board to deliver the next stage.\n● If appropriate, review the lessons at this time, particularly for longer projects where interim reviews of lessons (or the project itself) may benefit business."

      "content": "Closure activities should be planned as part of the stage plan for the final stage. When closing a project, work is required to prepare information to the project board to obtain its authorization to close the project. Subsequently, the project executive should also notify the business layer that the project has closed (see section 14.4.5).\nIt is also possible that the project board may wish to trigger a premature closure of the project under some circumstances; for example, if the business case is no longer valid. If the project is being brought to a premature close, this process will still need to be executed.\nSeveral actions specific to the project product may be required after the project; these should be documented and planned as follow-on action recommendations. The actions may have different audiences and therefore may need to be issued individually. The needs of the recipient will determine the format and content; some may want a formal report, some a log entry on a system, whereas others may want a meeting.\nTable 19.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs for closing a project (Lists Inputs, Activities, and Outputs for closing a project, covering planned closure and premature closure.)\n19.4.1 Prepare planned closure\nA closure recommendation can be raised to the project board after the project manager has confirmed that the project can be closed.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Use the communication management approach to identify any organization or interested party that needs to know that the project is closing. (Consider communication activities for public relations and marketing opportunities at this point.)\n● Close the project log.\n● Ensure that all project information is secured and archived (in accordance with the issue management approach) to permit any future audit of the project management team’s decisions, actions, and performance.\n● Prepare a draft project closure notification for review by the project board.\n19.4.2 Prepare premature closure\nIn some situations, the project board may have instructed the project manager to close the project prematurely. In such circumstances, the project manager must ensure that work-in-progress is not simply abandoned but that the project salvages anything of value created to date and checks that any gaps left by the cancellation of the project are raised to the business.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Update the project log (and, if necessary, the issue report) to record the premature closure request.\n● Update the project plan with actuals from the final stage.\n● Request the product status from project support. From this, determine which of the project product’s components: have been approved by the authorities identified in their product descriptions, are currently in development (and which of those need to be completed), are covered by approved concessions, are yet to be started, need to be made safe, may be useful to other projects.\n● If appropriate, agree the means for recovering products that have been completed or are in progress. This will need the project board’s consultation and may include additional work to create, make safe, or complete products that might be useful to other projects (for example, making an unfinished building safe and weatherproof). In some cases, the additional work may require an exception plan.\n● Seek approval to give notice to the business that resources and people can be or are about to be released early.\n19.4.3 Confirm project acceptance\nThe project products must be passed to an operational and maintenance environment prior to the project closure. This may happen as a single release at the end of the project, or the project approach may include a phased delivery where products are delivered in several releases. In the case of a premature closure, there may be some products that have been approved but not yet delivered. Depending on the project board’s guidance, the ownership of some or all of those products may need to be transferred to the users.\nWhen delivering products, the benefits management approach may need to be updated to include the post-project benefits review or reviews of the performance of the project product in operational use. Such benefits reviews may identify whether there have been any side effects (beneficial or adverse) that could provide useful lessons for other projects.\nThere may be multiple handovers throughout the project lifecycle. It is not a project activity to undertake the benefits review after the completion of the project, but only to plan for such benefits reviews to occur. If the project is part of a programme, then the post-project benefits reviews need to be covered by the programme’s benefits management activities.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Prepare follow-on action recommendations for the project product to include any uncompleted work, issues, and risks in consultation with the project management team. There could be separate follow-on action recommendations for the project product or its components or for each distinct user group (such as human resources, finance, and operations).\n● Check that the benefits management approach includes post-project activities to confirm benefits that cannot be measured until after the project product has been in operational use for some time, such as reliability performance.\n● Examine the project initiation documentation to confirm how products are to be delivered to those who will maintain them in their operational life.\n19.4.4 Evaluate the project\nSuccessful organizations learn from experience with projects. When evaluating the project, the objective is to assess how successful the project has been or in the case of premature close, evaluating the project and the reasons for early closure. It may also be possible to improve the estimation for future projects by analysing the estimates and the actual progress metrics for this project.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Review the project’s original intent as agreed in the initiation stage and defined by the project initiation documentation and baselined at that time.\n● Review the approved changes as defined by the current version of the components of the project initiation documentation.\n● Prepare an end project report in consultation with the project management team.\n● Review the project log to identify lessons that could be applied to future projects and include them in the lessons report in consultation with the project management team.\n19.4.5 Request project closure\nTo finish the current stage and close the project, the project manager contacts the project board to request project closure. The project manager will emphasize the importance of celebrating the project success and suggest some form of appreciation by the project board to all involved. The formal justification for project closure can be found in the end project report.\nRecommended actions for the project manager:\n● Brief the project board with a summary of the performance of the project, and confirm readiness to close, highlighting where there are concessions for any off-specifications.\n● Request project closure from the project board."
